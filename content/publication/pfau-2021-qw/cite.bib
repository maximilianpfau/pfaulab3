 abstract = {Purpose: To probabilistically forecast needed anti-vascular
endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment frequency using
volumetric spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)
biomarkers in neovascular age-related macular degeneration from
real-world settings. Methods: SD-OCT volume scans were segmented
with a custom deep-learning-based analysis pipeline. Retinal
thickness and reflectivity values were extracted for the central
and the four inner Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
(ETDRS) subfields for six retinal layers (inner retina, outer
nuclear layer, inner segments [IS], outer segments [OS], retinal
pigment epithelium-drusen complex [RPEDC] and the choroid).
Machine-learning models were probed to predict the anti-VEGF
treatment frequency within the next 12 months. Probabilistic
forecasting was performed using natural gradient boosting
(NGBoost), which outputs a full probability distribution. The
mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted versus actual
anti-VEGF treatment frequency was the primary outcome measure.
Results: In a total of 138 visits of 99 eyes with neovascular
AMD (96 patients) from two clinical centers, the prediction of
future anti-VEGF treatment frequency was observed with an
accuracy (MAE [95% confidence interval]) of 2.60
injections/year [2.25-2.96] (R2 = 0.390) using random forest
regression and 2.66 injections/year [2.31-3.01] (R2 = 0.094)
using NGBoost, respectively. Prediction intervals were well
calibrated and reflected the true uncertainty of NGBoost-based
predictions. Standard deviation of RPEDC-thickness in the
central ETDRS-subfield constituted an important predictor across
models. Conclusions: The proposed, fully automated pipeline
enables probabilistic forecasting of future anti-VEGF treatment
frequency in real-world settings. Translational Relevance:
Prediction of a probability distribution allows the physician to
inspect the underlying uncertainty. Predictive uncertainty
estimates are essential to highlight cases where
human-inspection and/or reversion to a fallback alternative is
warranted.},
