 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate multimodal retinal imaging
characteristics including the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)
thickness in patients with RPGR-associated retinitis pigmentosa
(RP). METHODS: This cross-sectional case-control study included
17 consecutive patients (median age, 21 years) with
RPGR-associated RP who underwent retinal imaging including
optical coherence tomography (OCT), short-wavelength fundus
autofluorescence (AF) imaging, and RNFL scans centered on the
optic disc. RNFL thickness was manually segmented and compared
to clinical and imaging parameters including the transfoveal
ellipsoid zone (EZ) width, the horizontal diameter of the
macular hyperautofluorescent ring. RNFL thickness was compared
to 17 age- and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: In patients with
RPGR-associated RP, the EZ width (R2 = 0.65), the central
hyperautofluorescent ring on AF images (R2 = 0.72), and visual
acuity (R2 = 0.68) were negatively correlated with age. In
comparison to controls, a significantly (p < 0.0001) increased
global RNFL thickness was identified in RPGR-associated RP,
which was, however, less pronounced in progressed disease as
indicated by the EZ width or the diameter of the central
hyperautofluorescent ring. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes
retinal characteristics in patients with RPGR-associated RP
including a pronounced peripapillary RNFL thickness compared to
healthy controls. These results contribute to the knowledge
about imaging biomarkers in RP, which might be of interest for
therapeutic approaches such as gene replacement therapies.},
