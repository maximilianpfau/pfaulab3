 abstract = {Purpose: To examine the topographic correlation between retinal
morphology and retinal sensitivity by mesopic and scotopic
fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in eyes with intermediate AMD.
Methods: Thirty-five eyes from 32 patients (mean age 70.9 years)
and 29 age-matched controls prospectively underwent
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging.
Mesopic (Goldman III, 200 ms, 4-2 strategy) and scotopic (Goldman
V, 200 ms, 4-2 strategy) FCP with a 56-stimulus point grid was
performed in AMD patients with the MP-1S. Thickness values of
different retinal layers were measured at each stimulus point and
compared, topographically corresponding to values in controls of
similar age for pointwise structural-functional analysis.
Results: The overall mean sensitivity in patients was 16.9 $±$
3.0 dB for mesopic and 14.0 $±$ 3.7 dB for scotopic testing.
Within the central 4° of the macula, reduced mesopic and scotopic
sensitivity values were found (P < 0.0001). These findings
correlated to central increasing retinal pigment
epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC) thickness and central
decreasing outer nuclear layer (ONL) and photoreceptor
(PR)-segments thickness (P < 0.0001, respectively).
Structure-function correlations revealed that a reduction of
mesopic and scotopic sensitivity was associated with increasing
thickness of the total retina and the RPEDC and a decrease of the
ONL and the PR-segments (P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions:
Accumulation of sub-RPE material in patients with intermediate
AMD is spatially associated to quantifiable structural
alterations in various retinal layers and to corresponding
retinal dysfunction. The topographic analysis of retinal
thickness and retinal sensitivity will be helpful for a better
understanding of the disease process and for the evaluation of
new interventional approaches.},
