 abstract = {Purpose: Hypertensive crisis causes end-organ damage through
small-vessel damage as described histologically. Noninvasive
optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) makes it
possible to image retinal and choroidal capillaries on a
microscopic level in vivo. We quantified eye vessel perfusion
changes in hypertensive crisis using OCTA. Methods: Patients
with hypertensive crisis (systolic blood pressure $≥$180 mm
Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure $≥$110 mm Hg) and
age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. OCTA en
face 3 $\times$ 3-mm images of the superficial and deep retinal
layers and the choriocapillaris were acquired. Outcome
parameters included vessel density (VD) and vessel skeleton
density (VSD) of the superficial and deep retinal layers, as
well as flow voids of the choriocapillaris. Results:
Twenty-eight eyes of 17 patients and 31 age-matched control eyes
of 18 healthy subjects were included. VD and VSD of the deep
retinal layer were significantly reduced in hypertensive crisis
(P $łeq$ 0.004). Choriocapillaris signal intensity was more
heterogeneous in patients, and flow voids exhibited confluence
with a larger average area and a lower absolute count (P $łeq$
0.045). These changes were independent of time since onset of
hypertensive crisis and of the presence and extent of
retinopathy. Deep retinal changes were associated with renal
end-organ failure (P = 0.045). Conclusions: Hypertensive crisis
is associated with a significant reduction in retinal and
choroidal capillary perfusion based on OCTA findings. These
alterations are independent of retinopathy and related to
end-organ damage. Translational Relevance: OCTA might help
distinguish hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency
earlier than currently possible.},
