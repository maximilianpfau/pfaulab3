 abstract = {PURPOSE: To define, characterize, and classify hyperreflectivity
on optical coherence tomography and report its prevalence in
macular telangiectasia Type 2. METHODS: In a primary
cross-sectional analysis, multimodal imaging data were
retrospectively analyzed. The definition of hyperreflectivity
and neovascularization on optical coherence tomography followed
optical coherence tomography angiography-based criteria. Eyes
were graded for the presence of hyperreflectivity and
neovascularization and further categorized into three classes
based on position and extent of hyperreflectivity. In a
secondary analysis, eyes were reviewed for $â‰¥$24 months using
optical coherence tomography imaging. RESULTS: Three hundred and
twenty-two eyes from 161 patients were analyzed in the
cross-sectional analysis. Hyperreflectivity was found in 177
(55%) and neovascular membranes in 49 (15%) eyes.
Hyperreflectivity correlated significantly with parameters
indicative of disease progression. In the longitudinal analysis,
206 eyes from 103 patients were reviewed over a mean of 35.6
months. 17/86 eyes (20%) showed a de novo development of
hyperreflectivity. 8/29 eyes (28%) with preexistent
intraretinal hyperreflectivity developed outer retinal
hyperreflectivity. A high proportion of eyes with outer retinal
hyperreflectivity (17/52 [33%]) developed neovascular
membranes. CONCLUSION: Hyperreflectivity represents a common
finding in macular telangiectasia Type 2 but lacks a uniform
definition. We propose a hyperreflectivity grading scale that
may help to estimate disease progression and identify eyes at
risk for developing neovascular membranes.},
