abstract: 'PURPOSE: To define, characterize, and classify hyperreflectivity on optical
  coherence tomography and report its prevalence in macular telangiectasia Type 2.
  METHODS: In a primary cross-sectional analysis, multimodal imaging data were retrospectively
  analyzed. The definition of hyperreflectivity and neovascularization on optical
  coherence tomography followed optical coherence tomography angiography-based criteria.
  Eyes were graded for the presence of hyperreflectivity and neovascularization and
  further categorized into three classes based on position and extent of hyperreflectivity.
  In a secondary analysis, eyes were reviewed for $â‰¥$24 months using optical coherence
  tomography imaging. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-two eyes from 161 patients
  were analyzed in the cross-sectional analysis. Hyperreflectivity was found in 177
  (55%) and neovascular membranes in 49 (15%) eyes. Hyperreflectivity correlated significantly
  with parameters indicative of disease progression. In the longitudinal analysis,
  206 eyes from 103 patients were reviewed over a mean of 35.6 months. 17/86 eyes
  (20%) showed a de novo development of hyperreflectivity. 8/29 eyes (28%) with preexistent
  intraretinal hyperreflectivity developed outer retinal hyperreflectivity. A high
  proportion of eyes with outer retinal hyperreflectivity (17/52 [33%]) developed
  neovascular membranes. CONCLUSION: Hyperreflectivity represents a common finding
  in macular telangiectasia Type 2 but lacks a uniform definition. We propose a hyperreflectivity
  grading scale that may help to estimate disease progression and identify eyes at
  risk for developing neovascular membranes.'
