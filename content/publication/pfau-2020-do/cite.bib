 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate retinal sensitivity in the junctional
zone of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular
degeneration using patient-tailored perimetry grids for mesopic
and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry. METHODS:
Twenty-five eyes with GA of 25 patients (prospective,
natural-history Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy study
[DSGA; NCT02051998]) and 40 eyes of 40 normal subjects were
included. Patient-tailored perimetry grids were generated using
annotated fundus autofluorescence data. Customized software
positioned test-points along iso-hulls surrounding the GA
boundary at distances of 0.43°, 0.86°, 1.29°, 2.15°, and 3.01°.
The grids were used for duplicate mesopic and dark-adapted
two-color (cyan and red) fundus-controlled perimetry.
Age-adjusted reference-data were obtained through regression
analysis of normative data followed by spatial interpolation.
RESULTS: The mean sensitivity loss for mesopic testing decreased
with the distance to GA (-10.3 dB [0.43°], -8.2 dB [0.86°], -7.1
dB [1.29°], -6.8 dB [2.15°], and -6.6 dB [3.01°]; P < 0.01).
Dark-adapted cyan sensitivity loss exceeded dark-adapted red
sensitivity loss for all iso-hulls (-14.8 vs. -11.7 dB, -13.5
vs. -10.1 dB, -12.8 vs. -9.1 dB, -11.6 vs. -8.2 dB, -10.7 vs.
-8.0 dB; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patient-tailored
fundus-controlled perimetry grids allowed for testing of retinal
function in the junctional zone of GA with high spatial
resolution. A distinct decrease in mesopic sensitivity loss
between 0.43° (125 µm) and 1.29° (375 µm) was observed that
leveled off at more distant test-points. In proximity to the GA
boundary, the results indicate that rod exceeded cone
dysfunction.},
