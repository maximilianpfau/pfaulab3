abstract: 'Purpose: To investigate characteristics of the foveal pit and the foveal
  avascular zone (FAZ) in patients with Alport syndrome (AS), a rare monogenetic disease
  due to mutations in genes encoding for collagen type IV. Methods: Twenty-eight eyes
  of nine patients with AS, and five autosomal-recessive carriers and 15 eyes from
  15 age-similar healthy control subjects were examined using optical coherence tomography
  (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCT-A). Foveal configuration and FAZ measures including
  the FAZ area, circularity, and vessel density in the central 1° and 3° were correlated.
  Results: Foveal hypoplasia was found in 10 eyes from seven patients with either
  genotype. In contrast, a staircase foveopathy was found in seven eyes of four X-linked
  AS patients. The average FAZ area did not differ significantly between AS patients
  and control subjects (mean $±$ SD 0.24 $±$ 0.24 mm2 vs. 0.21 $±$ 0.09 mm2; P = 0.64).
  Five eyes showed absence or severe anomalies of the FAZ with crossing macular capillaries
  that was linked to the degree of foveal hypoplasia on OCT images leading to a significant
  inverse correlation of FAZ area and foveal thickness (r = -0.88; P < 0.001). In
  contrary, female patients with X-linked mutations exhibited a significantly greater
  FAZ area (0.48 $±$ 0.30 mm2 vs. 0.21 $±$ 0.09 mm2; P = 0.007), in line with OCT
  findings of a staircase foveopathy. Conclusions: The foveal phenotypic spectrum
  in AS ranges from foveal hypoplasia and absence of a FAZ to staircase foveopathy
  with an enlarged FAZ. Because the development of the FAZ and foveal pit are closely
  related, these findings suggest an important role for collagen type IV in foveal
  development and maturation.'
