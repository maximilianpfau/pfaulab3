 abstract = {Purpose: To investigate characteristics of the foveal pit and
the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in patients with Alport syndrome
(AS), a rare monogenetic disease due to mutations in genes
encoding for collagen type IV. Methods: Twenty-eight eyes of
nine patients with AS, and five autosomal-recessive carriers and
15 eyes from 15 age-similar healthy control subjects were
examined using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
OCT-angiography (OCT-A). Foveal configuration and FAZ measures
including the FAZ area, circularity, and vessel density in the
central 1° and 3° were correlated. Results: Foveal hypoplasia
was found in 10 eyes from seven patients with either genotype.
In contrast, a staircase foveopathy was found in seven eyes of
four X-linked AS patients. The average FAZ area did not differ
significantly between AS patients and control subjects (mean
$±$ SD 0.24 $±$ 0.24 mm2 vs. 0.21 $±$ 0.09 mm2; P = 0.64).
Five eyes showed absence or severe anomalies of the FAZ with
crossing macular capillaries that was linked to the degree of
foveal hypoplasia on OCT images leading to a significant inverse
correlation of FAZ area and foveal thickness (r = -0.88; P <
0.001). In contrary, female patients with X-linked mutations
exhibited a significantly greater FAZ area (0.48 $±$ 0.30 mm2
vs. 0.21 $±$ 0.09 mm2; P = 0.007), in line with OCT findings
of a staircase foveopathy. Conclusions: The foveal phenotypic
spectrum in AS ranges from foveal hypoplasia and absence of a
FAZ to staircase foveopathy with an enlarged FAZ. Because the
development of the FAZ and foveal pit are closely related, these
findings suggest an important role for collagen type IV in
foveal development and maturation.},
