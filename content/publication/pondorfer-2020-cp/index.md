abstract: 'The purpose of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of visual
  function tests in intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). A total
  of 62 subjects (38 patients with iAMD and 24 controls) were included and underwent
  several functional assessments: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), low luminance
  visual acuity (LLVA), visual acuity (VA) measured with the Moorfields Vanishing
  Optotypes Acuity Charts (MAC), contrast sensitivity with the Pelli-Robson test,
  reading speed using the International Reading Speed texts (IReST) and mesopic and
  dark-adapted microperimetry (S-MAIA, CenterVue, Padova, Italy). Groups were compared
  using non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests and ROC analyses. Linear regression
  was used to control for confounding. Results showed that all visual function test
  performances except the IReST were significantly reduced in iAMD patients compared
  to controls (p < 0.05). These effects did not alter after controlling for age and
  sex. Best discrimination between iAMD and controls yield the combination of LLVA
  and contrast sensitivity as well as MAC-VA and contrast sensitivity (ROC area under
  the curve 0.95 and 0.93, respectively). Our results suggest that LLVA, MAC-VA, contrast
  sensitivity and mesopic and dark-adapted microperimetry can capture visual impairment
  characteristic for iAMD. Best discrimination against iAMD is achieved with a combination
  of two tests.'
