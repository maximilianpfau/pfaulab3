 abstract = {The purpose of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy
of visual function tests in intermediate age-related macular
degeneration (iAMD). A total of 62 subjects (38 patients with
iAMD and 24 controls) were included and underwent several
functional assessments: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), low
luminance visual acuity (LLVA), visual acuity (VA) measured with
the Moorfields Vanishing Optotypes Acuity Charts (MAC), contrast
sensitivity with the Pelli-Robson test, reading speed using the
International Reading Speed texts (IReST) and mesopic and
dark-adapted microperimetry (S-MAIA, CenterVue, Padova, Italy).
Groups were compared using non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum
tests and ROC analyses. Linear regression was used to control
for confounding. Results showed that all visual function test
performances except the IReST were significantly reduced in iAMD
patients compared to controls (p < 0.05). These effects did not
alter after controlling for age and sex. Best discrimination
between iAMD and controls yield the combination of LLVA and
contrast sensitivity as well as MAC-VA and contrast sensitivity
(ROC area under the curve 0.95 and 0.93, respectively). Our
results suggest that LLVA, MAC-VA, contrast sensitivity and
mesopic and dark-adapted microperimetry can capture visual
impairment characteristic for iAMD. Best discrimination against
iAMD is achieved with a combination of two tests.},
