 abstract = {Sensitive and robust outcome measures of retinal function are
pivotal for clinical trials in age-related macular degeneration
(AMD). A recent development is the implementation of artificial
intelligence (AI) to infer results of psychophysical
examinations based on findings derived from multimodal imaging.
We conducted a review of the current literature referenced in
PubMed and Web of Science among others with the keywords
'artificial intelligence' and 'machine learning' in combination
with 'perimetry', 'best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)',
'retinal function' and 'age-related macular degeneration'. So
far AI-based structure-function correlations have been applied
to infer conventional visual field, fundus-controlled perimetry,
and electroretinography data, as well as BCVA, and
patient-reported outcome measures (PROM). In neovascular AMD,
inference of BCVA (hereafter termed inferred BCVA) can estimate
BCVA results with a root mean squared error of ~7-11 letters,
which is comparable to the accuracy of actual visual acuity
assessment. Further, AI-based structure-function correlation can
successfully infer fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) results
both for mesopic as well as dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red
testing (hereafter termed inferred sensitivity). Accuracy of
inferred sensitivity can be augmented by adding short FCP
examinations and reach mean absolute errors (MAE) of ~3-5 dB for
mesopic, DA cyan and DA red testing. Inferred BCVA, and inferred
retinal sensitivity, based on multimodal imaging, may be
considered as a quasi-functional surrogate endpoint for future
interventional clinical trials in the future.},
