 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic value of demographic,
functional, genetic, and imaging parameters on retinal pigment
epithelium atrophy progression secondary to ABCA4-related
retinopathy. METHODS: Patients with retinal pigment epithelium
atrophy secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy were examined
longitudinally with fundus autofluorescence imaging. Lesion
area, perimeter, circularity, caliper diameters, and focality of
areas with definitely decreased autofluorescence were
determined. A model was used to predict the lesion enlargement
rate based on baseline variables. Sample size calculations were
performed to model the power in a simulated interventional
study. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eyes of 37 patients (age range,
14-78 years) with a follow-up time of 10 to 100 months were
included. The mean annual progression of retinal pigment
epithelium atrophy was 0.89 mm. The number of atrophic areas,
the retina-wide functional impairment, and the age-of-onset
category constituted significant predictors for future retinal
pigment epithelium atrophy growth, explaining 25.7% of the
variability. By extension of a simulated study length and/or
specific patient preselection based on these baseline
characteristics, the required sample size could significantly be
reduced. CONCLUSION: Trial design based on specific
shape-descriptive factors and patients' baseline characteristics
and the adaption of the trial duration may provide potential
benefits in required cohort size and absolute number of visits.},
