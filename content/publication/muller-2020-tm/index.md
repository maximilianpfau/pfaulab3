abstract: "PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic value of demographic, functional,
  genetic, and imaging parameters on retinal pigment epithelium atrophy progression
  secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy. METHODS: Patients with retinal pigment epithelium
  atrophy secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy were examined longitudinally with
  fundus autofluorescence imaging. Lesion area, perimeter, circularity, caliper diameters,
  and focality of areas with definitely decreased autofluorescence were determined.
  A model was used to predict the lesion enlargement rate based on baseline variables.
  Sample size calculations were performed to model the power in a simulated interventional
  study. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eyes of 37 patients (age range, 14-78 years) with a
  follow-up time of 10 to 100 months were included. The mean annual progression of
  retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was 0.89 mm. The number of atrophic areas, the
  retina-wide functional impairment, and the age-of-onset category constituted significant
  predictors for future retinal pigment epithelium atrophy growth, explaining 25.7%
  of the variability. By extension of a simulated study length and/or specific patient
  preselection based on these baseline characteristics, the required sample size could
  significantly be reduced. CONCLUSION: Trial design based on specific shape-descriptive
  factors and patients' baseline characteristics and the adaption of the trial duration
  may provide potential benefits in required cohort size and absolute number of visits."
