 abstract = {Refined understanding of the association of retinal
microstructure with current and future (post-treatment) function
in chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (cCSC) may help to
identify patients that would benefit most from treatment. In
this post-hoc analysis of data from the prospective, randomized
PLACE trial (NCT01797861), we aimed to determine the accuracy of
AI-based inference of retinal function from retinal morphology
in cCSC. Longitudinal spectral-domain optical coherence
tomography (SD-OCT) data from 57 eyes of 57 patients from
baseline, week 6-8 and month 7-8 post-treatment were segmented
using deep-learning software. Fundus-controlled perimetry data
were aligned to the SD-OCT data to extract layer thickness and
reflectivity values for each test point. Point-wise retinal
sensitivity could be inferred with a (leave-one-out)
cross-validated mean absolute error (MAE) [95% CI] of 2.93 dB
[2.40-3.46] (scenario 1) using random forest regression. With
addition of patient-specific baseline data (scenario 2), retinal
sensitivity at remaining follow-up visits was estimated even
more accurately with a MAE of 1.07 dB [1.06-1.08]. In scenario
3, month 7-8 post-treatment retinal sensitivity was predicted
from baseline SD-OCT data with a MAE of 3.38 dB [2.82-3.94]. Our
study shows that localized retinal sensitivity can be inferred
from retinal structure in cCSC using machine-learning.
Especially, prediction of month 7-8 post-treatment sensitivity
with consideration of the treatment as explanatory variable
constitutes an important step toward personalized treatment
decisions in cCSC.},
