abstract: Refined understanding of the association of retinal microstructure with
  current and future (post-treatment) function in chronic central serous chorioretinopathy
  (cCSC) may help to identify patients that would benefit most from treatment. In
  this post-hoc analysis of data from the prospective, randomized PLACE trial (NCT01797861),
  we aimed to determine the accuracy of AI-based inference of retinal function from
  retinal morphology in cCSC. Longitudinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography
  (SD-OCT) data from 57 eyes of 57 patients from baseline, week 6-8 and month 7-8
  post-treatment were segmented using deep-learning software. Fundus-controlled perimetry
  data were aligned to the SD-OCT data to extract layer thickness and reflectivity
  values for each test point. Point-wise retinal sensitivity could be inferred with
  a (leave-one-out) cross-validated mean absolute error (MAE) [95% CI] of 2.93 dB
  [2.40-3.46] (scenario 1) using random forest regression. With addition of patient-specific
  baseline data (scenario 2), retinal sensitivity at remaining follow-up visits was
  estimated even more accurately with a MAE of 1.07 dB [1.06-1.08]. In scenario 3,
  month 7-8 post-treatment retinal sensitivity was predicted from baseline SD-OCT
  data with a MAE of 3.38 dB [2.82-3.94]. Our study shows that localized retinal sensitivity
  can be inferred from retinal structure in cCSC using machine-learning. Especially,
  prediction of month 7-8 post-treatment sensitivity with consideration of the treatment
  as explanatory variable constitutes an important step toward personalized treatment
  decisions in cCSC.
