abstract: "PURPOSE: To investigate the association between retinal microstructure
  and cone and rod function in geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular
  degeneration (AMD) by using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. DESIGN: Prospective,
  observational case series. METHODS: A total of 41 eyes of 41 patients (75.8 $±$
  8.4 years old; 22 females) from a tertiary referral hospital were included. Mesopic,
  dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red sensitivities were assessed by using fundus-controlled
  perimetry (``microperimetry''); and retinal microstructure was assessed by using
  spectral-domain optical-coherence-tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF),
  and near-infrared-reflectance (IR) imaging. Layer thicknesses and intensities and
  FAF and IR intensities were extracted for each test point. The cross-validated mean
  absolute error (MAE) was evaluated for random forest-based predictions of retinal
  sensitivity with and without patient-specific training data and percentage of increased
  mean-squared error (%IncMSE) as measurement of feature importance. RESULTS: Retinal
  sensitivity was predicted with a MAE of 4.64 dB for mesopic, 4.89 dB for DA cyan,
  and 4.40 dB for DA red testing in the absence of patient-specific data. Partial
  addition of patient-specific sensitivity data to the training sets decreased the
  MAE to 2.89 dB, 2.86 dB, and 2.77 dB. For all 3 types of testing, the outer nuclear
  layer thickness constituted the most important predictive feature (35.0, 42.22,
  and 53.74 %IncMSE). Spatially resolved mapping of ``inferred sensitivity'' revealed
  regions with differential degrees of mesopic and DA cyan sensitivity loss outside
  of the GA lesions. CONCLUSIONS: ``Inferred sensitivity'' accurately reflected retinal
  function in patients with GA. Mapping of ``inferred sensitivity'' could facilitate
  monitoring of disease progression and serve as ``quasi functional'' surrogate outcome
  in clinical trials, especially in consideration of retinal regions beyond areas
  of GA."
