 abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the intrasession test-retest reliability of
scotopic cyan and scotopic red fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP)
in normal subjects using a modified MAIA ``microperimeter''
(macular integrity assessment) device. METHODS: Forty-seven
normal eyes of 30 subjects (aged 33.8 years) underwent duplicate
mesopic (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm), scotopic cyan (505
nm), and scotopic red (627 nm) FCP, using a grid of 49 stimuli
over 14° of the central retina. Test-retest reliability for
pointwise sensitivity (PWS), stability of fixation, reaction
time and test duration were analyzed using mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: PWS test-retest reliability was good among all 3 types
of retinal sensitivity assessments (coefficient of repeatability
of 4.75 dB for mesopic, 5.26 dB for scotopic cyan, and 4.06 dB
for scotopic red testing). While the mean sensitivity decreased
with eccentricity for both mesopic and scotopic red testing, it
was highest at 7° eccentricity for the scotopic cyan assessment
(p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The modified MAIA device allows for
reliable scotopic FCP in normal subjects. Our findings suggest
that testing of scotopic cyan sensitivity largely reflects rod
function.},
