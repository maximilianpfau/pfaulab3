abstract: "PURPOSE: To assess the intrasession test-retest reliability of scotopic
  cyan and scotopic red fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in normal subjects using
  a modified MAIA ``microperimeter'' (macular integrity assessment) device. METHODS:
  Forty-seven normal eyes of 30 subjects (aged 33.8 years) underwent duplicate mesopic
  (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm), scotopic cyan (505 nm), and scotopic red (627
  nm) FCP, using a grid of 49 stimuli over 14° of the central retina. Test-retest
  reliability for pointwise sensitivity (PWS), stability of fixation, reaction time
  and test duration were analyzed using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: PWS test-retest
  reliability was good among all 3 types of retinal sensitivity assessments (coefficient
  of repeatability of 4.75 dB for mesopic, 5.26 dB for scotopic cyan, and 4.06 dB
  for scotopic red testing). While the mean sensitivity decreased with eccentricity
  for both mesopic and scotopic red testing, it was highest at 7° eccentricity for
  the scotopic cyan assessment (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The modified MAIA device
  allows for reliable scotopic FCP in normal subjects. Our findings suggest that testing
  of scotopic cyan sensitivity largely reflects rod function."
