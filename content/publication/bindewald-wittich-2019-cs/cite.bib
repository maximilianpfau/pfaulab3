 abstract = {A 37-year-old male patient presented with metamorphopsia and
unilateral visual impairment with the presence of hundreds of
bilateral avascular retinal pigment epithelial detachments
(PEDs). The patient suffered from allergic bronchial asthma
which was treated with inhaled corticosteroids. Cessation of
corticosteroid treatment resulted in flattening of larger PEDs
and subsequent transition to atrophic areas over time while
smaller PEDs persisted and spread peripherally over an
observation period of 14Â½ years.},
