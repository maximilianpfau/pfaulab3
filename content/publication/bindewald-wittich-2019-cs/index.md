abstract: A 37-year-old male patient presented with metamorphopsia and unilateral
  visual impairment with the presence of hundreds of bilateral avascular retinal pigment
  epithelial detachments (PEDs). The patient suffered from allergic bronchial asthma
  which was treated with inhaled corticosteroids. Cessation of corticosteroid treatment
  resulted in flattening of larger PEDs and subsequent transition to atrophic areas
  over time while smaller PEDs persisted and spread peripherally over an observation
  period of 14Â½ years.
