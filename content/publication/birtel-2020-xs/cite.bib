 abstract = {Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are characterized by high
clinical and genetic heterogeneity. A precise characterization
is desirable for diagnosis and has impact on prognosis, patient
counseling, and potential therapeutic options. Here, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of in-depth
retinal phenotyping and molecular genetic testing in complex
pedigrees with different IRDs. Four affected Caucasians and two
unaffected relatives were characterized including multimodal
retinal imaging, functional testing, and targeted
next-generation sequencing. A considerable intrafamilial
phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity was identified. While the
parents of the index family presented with rod-cone dystrophy
and ABCA4-related retinopathy, their two sons revealed
characteristics in the spectrum of incomplete congenital
stationary night blindness and ocular albinism, respectively.
Molecular testing revealed previously described variants in RHO,
ABCA4, and MITF as well as a novel variant in CACNA1F.
Identified variants were verified by intrafamilial
co-segregation, bioinformatic annotations, and in silico
analysis. The coexistence of four independent IRDs caused by
distinct mutations and inheritance modes in one pedigree is
demonstrated. These findings highlight the complexity of IRDs
and underscore the need for the combination of extensive
molecular genetic testing and clinical characterization. In
addition, a novel variant in the CACNA1F gene is reported
associated with incomplete congenital stationary night
blindness.},
