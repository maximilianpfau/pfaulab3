abstract: Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are characterized by high clinical
  and genetic heterogeneity. A precise characterization is desirable for diagnosis
  and has impact on prognosis, patient counseling, and potential therapeutic options.
  Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of in-depth retinal phenotyping
  and molecular genetic testing in complex pedigrees with different IRDs. Four affected
  Caucasians and two unaffected relatives were characterized including multimodal
  retinal imaging, functional testing, and targeted next-generation sequencing. A
  considerable intrafamilial phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity was identified.
  While the parents of the index family presented with rod-cone dystrophy and ABCA4-related
  retinopathy, their two sons revealed characteristics in the spectrum of incomplete
  congenital stationary night blindness and ocular albinism, respectively. Molecular
  testing revealed previously described variants in RHO, ABCA4, and MITF as well as
  a novel variant in CACNA1F. Identified variants were verified by intrafamilial co-segregation,
  bioinformatic annotations, and in silico analysis. The coexistence of four independent
  IRDs caused by distinct mutations and inheritance modes in one pedigree is demonstrated.
  These findings highlight the complexity of IRDs and underscore the need for the
  combination of extensive molecular genetic testing and clinical characterization.
  In addition, a novel variant in the CACNA1F gene is reported associated with incomplete
  congenital stationary night blindness.
