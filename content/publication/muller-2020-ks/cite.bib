 abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically and longitudinally investigate the
characteristics of flecks in ABCA4-related retinopathy under
different fundus autofluorescence (AF) excitation and emission
spectra. METHODS: A total of 132 eyes of 66 patients with
ABCA4-related retinopathy were investigated using multimodal AF
imaging and spectral domain optical coherence tomography.
Autofluorescence imaging with blue (BAF), green (GAF), and
near-infrared (NIR-AF) excitation wavelengths obtained by a
confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope was compared with AF
imaging obtained by an innovative confocal light-emitting
diode-based retinal imaging system (Color-AF) that allows for
separation of short (green emission fluorescent component) and
long (red emission fluorescent component) autofluorescence
emission components. RESULTS: Color-AF, BAF, and GAF, overall,
revealed similar presentation of hyperautofluorescent flecks.
Flecks that showed predominantly red emission fluorescent
component matched with hyperautofluorescent flecks in NIR-AF.
Over the observation time of 5 to 14 months, flecks showed a
transition in the AF emission spectrum to shorter wavelengths
(red emission fluorescent component to green emission
fluorescent component), associated with a progressed disruption
of overlaying outer retinal bands in optical coherence
tomography. Newer hyperautofluorescent flecks usually revealed
predominantly red emission fluorescent component. CONCLUSION: By
separation of the AF spectra, the remodeling of fluorophores and
associated structural changes can be monitored over time
indicating a novel and susceptible surrogate marker for disease
progression and potential therapeutic effects.},
