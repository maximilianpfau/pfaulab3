abstract: 'PURPOSE: To systematically and longitudinally investigate the characteristics
  of flecks in ABCA4-related retinopathy under different fundus autofluorescence (AF)
  excitation and emission spectra. METHODS: A total of 132 eyes of 66 patients with
  ABCA4-related retinopathy were investigated using multimodal AF imaging and spectral
  domain optical coherence tomography. Autofluorescence imaging with blue (BAF), green
  (GAF), and near-infrared (NIR-AF) excitation wavelengths obtained by a confocal
  scanning laser ophthalmoscope was compared with AF imaging obtained by an innovative
  confocal light-emitting diode-based retinal imaging system (Color-AF) that allows
  for separation of short (green emission fluorescent component) and long (red emission
  fluorescent component) autofluorescence emission components. RESULTS: Color-AF,
  BAF, and GAF, overall, revealed similar presentation of hyperautofluorescent flecks.
  Flecks that showed predominantly red emission fluorescent component matched with
  hyperautofluorescent flecks in NIR-AF. Over the observation time of 5 to 14 months,
  flecks showed a transition in the AF emission spectrum to shorter wavelengths (red
  emission fluorescent component to green emission fluorescent component), associated
  with a progressed disruption of overlaying outer retinal bands in optical coherence
  tomography. Newer hyperautofluorescent flecks usually revealed predominantly red
  emission fluorescent component. CONCLUSION: By separation of the AF spectra, the
  remodeling of fluorophores and associated structural changes can be monitored over
  time indicating a novel and susceptible surrogate marker for disease progression
  and potential therapeutic effects.'
