 abstract = {IMPORTANCE: As a disabling and frequent disease, geographic
atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
constitutes an important study subject. Emerging clinical trials
require suitable end points. The characterization and validation
of reading performance as a functional outcome parameter is
warranted. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate reading
performance in geographic atrophy and to assess its association
with established visual function assessments and structural
biomarkers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The
noninterventional, prospective natural history Directional
Spread in Geographic Atrophy study included patients with
geographic atrophy secondary to AMD who were recruited at the
University Hospital in Bonn, Germany. Participants were enrolled
from June 2013 to June 2016. Analysis began December 2019 and
ended January 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reading acuity
and reading speed were assessed using Radner charts.
Longitudinal fundus autofluorescence and infrared reflectance
images were semiautomatically annotated for geographic atrophy,
followed by extraction of shape-descriptive variables. Linear
mixed-effects models were applied to investigate the association
of those variables with reading performance. RESULTS: A total of
150 eyes of 85 participants were included in this study (median
[IQR] age, 77.9 [72.4-82.1] years; 51 women [60%]; 34 men
[40%]). Reading performance was impaired with a median (IQR)
monocular reading acuity of 0.9 (0.4-1.3) logarithm of the
reading acuity determination and a reading speed of 52.8 (0-123)
words per minute. In the multivariable cross-sectional analysis,
best-corrected visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the
central Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
subfield, classification of noncenter vs center-involving
geographic atrophy, and area of geographic atrophy in the
inner-right ETDRS subfield showed strongest associations with
reading acuity (cross-validated R2for reading acuity = 0.69).
Regarding reading speed, the most relevant variables were
best-corrected visual acuity, low-luminance visual acuity, area
of geographic atrophy in the central ETDRS subfield, in the
inner-right ETDRS subfield, and in the inner-upper ETDRS
subfield (R2 for reading speed = 0.67). In the longitudinal
analysis, a similar prediction accuracy for reading performance
was determined (R2 for reading acuity = 0.73; R2 for reading
speed = 0.70). Prediction accuracy did not improve when
follow-up time was added as an independent variable. Binocular
reading performance did not differ from reading performance in
the better-seeing eye. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The
association of reading acuity and speed with visual functional
and structural biomarkers supports the validity of reading
performance as a meaningful end point in clinical trials. These
findings suggest that measures in clinical and low-vision care
for patients with geographic atrophy should focus primarily on
the better-seeing eye.},
