 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Empirical models have been an integral part of
everyday clinical practice in ophthalmology since the
introduction of the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK) formula. Recent
developments in the field of statistical learning (artificial
intelligence, AI) now enable an empirical approach to a wide
range of ophthalmological questions with an unprecedented
precision. OBJECTIVE: Which criteria must be considered for the
evaluation of AI-related studies in ophthalmology? MATERIAL AND
METHODS: Exemplary prediction of visual acuity (continuous
outcome) and classification of healthy and diseased eyes
(discrete outcome) using retrospectively compiled optical
coherence tomography data (50 eyes of 50 patients, 50 healthy
eyes of 50 subjects). The data were analyzed with nested
cross-validation (for learning algorithm selection and
hyperparameter optimization). RESULTS: Based on nested
cross-validation for training, visual acuity could be predicted
in the separate test data-set with a mean absolute error (MAE,
95% confidence interval, CI of 0.142 LogMAR [0.077; 0.207]).
Healthy versus diseased eyes could be classified in the test
data-set with an agreement of 0.92 (Cohen's kappa). The
exemplary incorrect learning algorithm and variable selection
resulted in an MAE for visual acuity prediction of 0.229 LogMAR
[0.150; 0.309] for the test data-set. The drastic overfitting
became obvious on comparison of the MAE with the null model MAE
(0.235 LogMAR [0.148; 0.322]). CONCLUSION: Selection of an
unsuitable measure of the goodness-of-fit, inadequate
validation, or withholding of a null or reference model can
obscure the actual goodness-of-fit of AI models. The illustrated
pitfalls can help clinicians to identify such shortcomings.},
