abstract: 'PURPOSE: To assess the longitudinal association between outer retinal microstructure
  and mesopic as well as scotopic retinal sensitivity in patients with drusen secondary
  to intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal
  natural history study. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-nine eyes of 54 patients with large drusen
  (> 125 $μ$m) associated with iAMD and 27 age-matched healthy control eyes. METHODS:
  Participants underwent spectral-domain OCT and both mesopic and scotopic fundus-controlled
  perimetry (FCP). Annual follow-up visits were performed over a 3-year period. MAIN
  OUTCOME MEASURES: Pointwise correlation of retinal sensitivity stimuli to corresponding
  standardized (Z score) pointwise retinal thickness. Linear mixed-effect models were
  applied to analyze longitudinally the association of pointwise retinal thickness
  changes, follow-up time, or both with retinal function. RESULTS: At baseline, mean
  pointwise sensitivity in patients was reduced by -1.67 dB (95% confidence interval
  [CI], -2.22 to -1.12) for mesopic and by -2.34 dB (95% CI, -2.85 to -1.84) for scotopic
  testing compared with controls with a pointwise sensitivity change of -0.35 dB/year
  (95% CI, -0.43 to -0.28) for mesopic and +0.20 dB/year (95% CI, 0.12-0.29) for scotopic
  testing, respectively (P < 0.001). Retinal thickness analysis in patients revealed
  a significantly thinner outer nuclear layer (ONL) by -0.49 standard deviation (SD;
  95% CI, -0.70 to -0.28 SD) and a significant thicker retinal pigment epithelium-drusen
  complex (RPEDC) by +3.22 SD (95% CI, 2.27-4.17 SD) at baseline, respectively (P
  < 0.001). During follow-up, retinal thickness thickened further by +0.51 SD/year
  (RPEDC) and thinned by -0.03 SD/year (ONL; P = 0.045) and -0.34 SD/year (inner and
  outer photoreceptor segments) in patients, respectively (P < 0.001). Structure-function
  analysis showed a significant association of the ONL and the RPEDC thickness change
  with both types of FCP sensitivity testing (P < 0.001). Besides, follow-up time
  had a significant (independent) effect on mesopic and scotopic retinal sensitivity
  (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The longitudinal structure-function correlation demonstrated
  a progressive quantifiable degeneration of the outer retina in iAMD associated with
  photoreceptor dysfunction. Because longitudinal sensitivity changes could not be
  explained by structural changes alone, an unmet need remains for additional refined
  parameters on retinal structure to predict retinal function.'
