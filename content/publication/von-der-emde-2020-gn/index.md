abstract: "Purpose: Based on exudative activity, choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
  in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can be classified as ``active'' aCNV,
  pretherapied ``silent'' sCNV (i.e., a treatment-free interval >12 weeks), or treatment-naı̈ve
  ``quiescent'' qCNV. We evaluated the qualitative and quantitative optical coherence
  tomography angiography (OCTA) features of these CNV subgroups. Methods: The presence
  of small-caliber vessels, peripheral arcades, and a ­perilesional OCTA signal attenuation
  as well as values for vessel length, density, and branching index were evaluated
  for each CNV network in a 6 $times$ 6 mm OCTA scan pattern. Results: Fifty-one eyes
  of 51 patients with AMD (age 75.9 $±$ 7.5 years; 20 males [39.2%]) were included.
  The qCNV subgroup (n = 8) showed the highest prevalence of qualitative and quantitative
  values for OCTA activity criteria, reaching significance with regard to small-caliber
  vessels (p = 0.003), peripheral arcades (p = 0.039), vessel length (p = 0.020),
  and branching index (p < 0.001) when compared to the aCNV (n = 32) and sCNV (n =
  11) subgroups. Qualitative criteria were inversely associated with the number of
  previous anti-VEGF injections (each p < 0.03), while quantitative metrics also suggested
  lower values. Conclusions: These findings suggest that OCTA may be supportive in
  the phenotypical differentiation of CNV lesions secondary to AMD, while the assessed
  structural changes appeared to be more indicative of previously administered anti-VEGF
  therapy than current exudative activity."
