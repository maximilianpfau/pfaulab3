abstract: 'Purpose: Relative ellipsoid zone reflectivity (rEZR) represents a potential
  biomarker of photoreceptor health on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography
  (SD-OCT). Because manual quantification of rEZR is laborious and lacks of spatial
  resolution, automated quantification of the rEZR would be beneficial. The purpose
  of this study was to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of an automated
  rEZR quantification method. Methods: The rEZR was acquired using a manual and an
  automated approach in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and healthy
  controls. The rEZR obtained from both methods was compared and the agreement between
  the methods and their reproducibility assessed. Results: Forty eyes of 40 participants
  with a mean ($±$ standard deviation) age of 65.2 $±$ 7.8 years were included. Both
  the manual and automated method showed that control eyes exhibit a greater rEZR
  than AMD eyes (P < 0.001). Overall, the limits of agreement between the manual and
  automated method were -7.5 to 7.3 arbitrary units (AU) and 95% of the data points
  had a difference in the rEZR between the methods of $±$8.2%. An expected perfect
  reproducibility was observed for the automated method, whereas the manual method
  had a coefficient of repeatability of 6.3 arbitrary units. Conclusions: The automated
  quantification of rEZR method is reliable and reproducible. Further studies of the
  rEZR as a novel biomarker for AMD severity and progression are warranted. Translational
  Relevance: Automated quantification of SD-OCT-based rEZR allows for its comprehensive
  and longitudinal characterization evaluating its relevance as an in vivo biomarker
  of photoreceptor function and its prognostic value for AMD progression.'
