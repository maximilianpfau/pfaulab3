 abstract = {Purpose: Relative ellipsoid zone reflectivity (rEZR) represents a
potential biomarker of photoreceptor health on spectral-domain
optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Because manual
quantification of rEZR is laborious and lacks of spatial
resolution, automated quantification of the rEZR would be
beneficial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
reliability and reproducibility of an automated rEZR
quantification method. Methods: The rEZR was acquired using a
manual and an automated approach in eyes with age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) and healthy controls. The rEZR obtained from
both methods was compared and the agreement between the methods
and their reproducibility assessed. Results: Forty eyes of 40
participants with a mean ($±$ standard deviation) age of 65.2
$±$ 7.8 years were included. Both the manual and automated
method showed that control eyes exhibit a greater rEZR than AMD
eyes (P < 0.001). Overall, the limits of agreement between the
manual and automated method were -7.5 to 7.3 arbitrary units (AU)
and 95% of the data points had a difference in the rEZR between
the methods of $±$8.2%. An expected perfect reproducibility
was observed for the automated method, whereas the manual method
had a coefficient of repeatability of 6.3 arbitrary units.
Conclusions: The automated quantification of rEZR method is
reliable and reproducible. Further studies of the rEZR as a novel
biomarker for AMD severity and progression are warranted.
Translational Relevance: Automated quantification of SD-OCT-based
rEZR allows for its comprehensive and longitudinal
characterization evaluating its relevance as an in vivo biomarker
of photoreceptor function and its prognostic value for AMD
progression.},
