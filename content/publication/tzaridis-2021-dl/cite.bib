 abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of optical coherence
tomography-angiography (OCT-A) for monitoring activity,
progression and response to therapy of neovascularisations (NVs)
secondary to macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel). METHODS: In
a retrospective analysis, eyes with NVs secondary to MacTel were
reviewed over a period of $â‰¥$8 months. Examinations at
monthly intervals included visual acuity testing, dilated
funduscopy, spectral domain-OCT and OCT-A. Eyes were treated
with intravitreal VEGF (vascular endothelial growth
factor)-inhibitors following a pro-re-nata (PRN) regime, and
treatment decisions were based on morphological signs of
activity as determined by B-scan OCT and funduscopy. Signs of
neovascular activity were defined as an increase in retinal
thickness, presence/increase of intraretinal/subretinal fluid
and haemorrhages. RESULTS: A total of 19 eyes from 17 patients
were analysed. Patients were evaluated over a mean period of
13.4 months (range: 8.9 to 24.2). OCT-A permitted the monitoring
of both treatment effects (regression) and progression (growth)
of NVs, but not neovascular activity. The growth of neovascular
vessels was detectable in OCT-A before signs of activity
occurred on OCT. NVs showed a progressive growth over time
despite PRN-treatment and preferentially grew and extended
within areas characterised by a focal reduction of
choriocapillaris perfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate
that OCT-A represents a useful imaging modality for monitoring
NV-progression and treatment effects in MacTel. We demonstrate
its advantages over conventional B-scan OCT imaging, including
an earlier detection of NV-progression, and propose an
adjustment of the current OCT-controlled PRN treatment regime in
order to prevent NV-progression and subsequent functional loss
in neovascular MacTel.},
