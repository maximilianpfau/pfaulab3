allows for spatially-resolved mapping of visual sensitivity and
measurement of fixation stability, both in clinical practice as
well as research. The accurate spatial characterization of
visual function enabled by FCP can provide insightful
information about disease severity and progression not reflected
by best-corrected visual acuity in a large range of disorders.
This is especially important for monitoring of retinal diseases
that initially spare the central retina in earlier disease
stages. Improved intra- and inter-session retest-variability
through fundus-tracking and precise point-wise follow-up
examinations even in patients with unstable fixation represent
key advantages of these technique. The design of
disease-specific test patterns and protocols reduces the burden
of extensive and time-consuming FCP testing, permitting a more
meaningful and focused application. Recent developments also
allow for photoreceptor-specific testing through implementation
of dark-adapted chromatic and photopic testing. A detailed
understanding of the variety of available devices and test
settings is a key prerequisite for the design and optimization
of FCP protocols in future natural history studies and clinical
trials. Accordingly, this review describes the theoretical and
technical background of FCP, its prior application in clinical
and research settings, data that qualify the application of FCP
as an outcome measure in clinical trials as well as ongoing and
future developments.},
