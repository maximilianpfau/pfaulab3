 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The presented study is a retrospective evaluation of
switching therapy from ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab to
aflibercept in neovascular age-related macular degeneration in
patients who had previously given an insufficient response to
therapy with ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab. PATIENTS AND
METHODS: 96 eyes with neovascular age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) were included, which had been pretreated with
ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab (T&E), but had responded
insufficiently. An injection interval of less than six weeks or
permanently persisting intra- and/or subretinal fluid or
persistent pigment epithelial detachments (PED) were defined as
an insufficient response. The patients were followed for 12
months after switching therapy to aflibercept. The change in
central retinal thickness (CRT) was defined as the primary
endpoint. Other endpoints were the axial height of PEDs and the
injection interval. RESULTS: The primary endpoint, the average
CRT, was significantly decreased twelve months after switching
therapy to aflibercept (Wilcoxon Nemenyi-McDonald-Thompson
post-hoc analysis - 31.36 µm; SD $±$ 70.64 µm; p < 0.001).
Another morphological endpoint, the average axial height of PEDs,
also decreased significantly (- 34.10 µm; SD $±$ 91.90 µm, p <
0.001) from 207.82 µm (SD $±$ 148.12 µm) at baseline to 173.72
µm (SD $±$ 132.30 µm) at month 12. Moreover, the average
injection interval increased significantly (p < 0.001; Friedman
test) from 1.30 months (SD $±$ 0.19 months) before switching
therapy to 1.67 months (SD $±$ 0.19 months) at month 12 after
switching therapy to aflibercept. However, the best corrected
visual acuity (BCVA) as a functional endpoint did not
significantly improve (+ 0.36 ETDRS letters = 0.0972 p; SD $±$
16.94 ETDRS letters). CONCLUSION: In patients with neovascular
AMD, who had initially exhibited an inadequate response to
ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab, switching therapy to aflibercept
improves clinical outcome measures. Besides morphological
improvements, such as the decrease of the CRT and the axial
height of PEDs, the average injection interval was prolonged.
However, visual acuity did not improve.},
