 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A retrospective, single-center
case-series was initiated to evaluate initial clinical
experience with the first commercially available intraoperative
optical coherence tomography system (iOCT). PATIENTS AND
METHODS: The Rescan 700 iOCT (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), a
spectral-domain OCT system integrated into a surgical
microscope, was used in 40 consecutive cases. A standardized
review was used to assess whether iOCT imaging resulted in
additional information and/or altered decision-making. RESULTS:
The iOCT system was usable in conjunction with common
chromovitrectomy dyes and tamponades. The surgeons reported that
iOCT imaging provided additional information in 74.1% of the
posterior and combined surgical cases, which resulted in altered
decision-making in 41.9% of the cases. The iOCT imaging time,
on average, amounted to 167 seconds. In anterior procedures, the
surgeons reported gaining additional information in 22.2% of
all cases, but no cases of altered decision-making were
reported. Hereby, the iOCT imaging time amounted to 117 seconds,
on average. CONCLUSION: The demonstrated results suggest iOCT
has the potential to improve the quality of posterior and
anterior segment surgery.},
