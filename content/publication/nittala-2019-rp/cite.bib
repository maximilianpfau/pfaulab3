 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate retinal sensitivity (RS)
by mesopic and scotopic microperimetry (MP-1S) in an elderly
Amish population with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mesopic and scotopic microperimetric
testing was performed in 148 eyes of 77 elderly Amish subjects
(age > 50 years) from Pennsylvania using a retinal function
analyzer. Scotopic testing was performed using a 2.0 log unit
neutral density filter following 30 minutes of dark adaptation.
All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examinations,
including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fundus
autofluorescence, infrared reflectance imaging, and flash color
fundus photography. Certified graders at Doheny Image Reading
Center identified subjects with evidence of AMD as defined by
the Beckman classification and quantified drusen volume. RS in
subjects with and without AMD was compared. Correlations between
RS and drusen burden were analyzed. Ten eyes with incomplete
MP-1S exams were excluded from the final analysis. RESULTS:
Among the 138 eyes from 77 subjects included in the final
analysis, 42 eyes from 29 subjects had evidence of early or
intermediate AMD. The mean age of subjects with AMD was 69.65
years $±$ 13.81 years versus 63.04 years $±$ 12.69 years in
those without AMD (P = .06). Mesopic RS was 18.8 dB $±$ 2.1 dB
in subjects with AMD and 19.6 dB $±$ 1.4 dB in those without
AMD (P = .07). Scotopic RS was significantly lower (P = .04) in
subjects with AMD (15.9 dB $±$ 2.9 dB) compared with those
without AMD (17.3 dB $±$ 2.4 dB). There was no relationship
between mesopic RS and either drusen area (r = -0.06; P = .32)
or drusen volume (r = -0.08; P = .30). There was a trend for an
association between scotopic RS and both drusen area (r = -0.39;
P = .24) and drusen volume (r = -0.36; P = .30). CONCLUSIONS: In
an elderly Amish population, eyes with early or intermediate AMD
show a greater reduction in scotopic RS than mesopic RS,
suggesting that rod function is more severely affected than cone
function. Drusen area and volume measurements better correlated
with scotopic RS. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina.
