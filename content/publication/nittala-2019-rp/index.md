abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate retinal sensitivity (RS) by mesopic
  and scotopic microperimetry (MP-1S) in an elderly Amish population with age-related
  macular degeneration (AMD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mesopic and scotopic microperimetric
  testing was performed in 148 eyes of 77 elderly Amish subjects (age > 50 years)
  from Pennsylvania using a retinal function analyzer. Scotopic testing was performed
  using a 2.0 log unit neutral density filter following 30 minutes of dark adaptation.
  All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examinations, including spectral-domain
  optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, infrared reflectance imaging,
  and flash color fundus photography. Certified graders at Doheny Image Reading Center
  identified subjects with evidence of AMD as defined by the Beckman classification
  and quantified drusen volume. RS in subjects with and without AMD was compared.
  Correlations between RS and drusen burden were analyzed. Ten eyes with incomplete
  MP-1S exams were excluded from the final analysis. RESULTS: Among the 138 eyes from
  77 subjects included in the final analysis, 42 eyes from 29 subjects had evidence
  of early or intermediate AMD. The mean age of subjects with AMD was 69.65 years
  $±$ 13.81 years versus 63.04 years $±$ 12.69 years in those without AMD (P = .06).
  Mesopic RS was 18.8 dB $±$ 2.1 dB in subjects with AMD and 19.6 dB $±$ 1.4 dB in
  those without AMD (P = .07). Scotopic RS was significantly lower (P = .04) in subjects
  with AMD (15.9 dB $±$ 2.9 dB) compared with those without AMD (17.3 dB $±$ 2.4 dB).
  There was no relationship between mesopic RS and either drusen area (r = -0.06;
  P = .32) or drusen volume (r = -0.08; P = .30). There was a trend for an association
  between scotopic RS and both drusen area (r = -0.39; P = .24) and drusen volume
  (r = -0.36; P = .30). CONCLUSIONS: In an elderly Amish population, eyes with early
  or intermediate AMD show a greater reduction in scotopic RS than mesopic RS, suggesting
  that rod function is more severely affected than cone function. Drusen area and
  volume measurements better correlated with scotopic RS. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers
