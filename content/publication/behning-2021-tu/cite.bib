 abstract = {BACKGROUND: To model the progression of geographic atrophy (GA)
in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by
building a suitable statistical regression model for GA size
measurements obtained from fundus autofluorescence imaging.
METHODS: Based on theoretical considerations, we develop a
linear mixed-effects model for GA size progression that
incorporates covariable-dependent enlargement rates as well as
correlations between longitudinally collected GA size
measurements. To capture nonlinear progression in a flexible
way, we systematically assess Box-Cox transformations with
different transformation parameters $łambda$. Model evaluation
is performed on data collected for two longitudinal, prospective
multi-center cohort studies on GA size progression. RESULTS: A
transformation parameter of $łambda$=0.45 yielded the best
model fit regarding the Akaike information criterion (AIC). When
hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were included as risk
factors in the model, they showed an association with
progression of GA size. The mean estimated age-of-onset in this
model was 67.21$±$6.49 years. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a
comprehensive framework for modeling the course of uni- or
bilateral GA size progression in longitudinal observational
studies. Specifically, the model allows for age-of-onset
estimation, identification of risk factors and prediction of
future GA size. A square-root transformation of atrophy size is
recommended before model fitting.},
