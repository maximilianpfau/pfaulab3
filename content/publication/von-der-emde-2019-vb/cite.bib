 abstract = {Spatially-resolved mapping of rod- and cone-function may
facilitate monitoring of macular diseases and serve as a
functional outcome parameter. However, mesopic and dark-adapted
two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP, also called
``microperimetry'') constitute laborious examinations. We have
devised a machine-learning-based approach to predict mesopic and
dark-adapted (DA) retinal sensitivity in eyes with neovascular
age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Extensive
psychophysical testing and volumetric multimodal retinal imaging
data were acquired including mesopic, DA red and DA cyan FCP,
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and confocal
scanning laser ophthalmoscopy infrared reflectance and fundus
autofluorescence imaging. With patient-wise leave-one-out
cross-validation, we have been able to achieve prediction
accuracies of (mean absolute error, MAE [95% CI]) 3.94 dB
[3.38, 4.5] for mesopic, 4.93 dB [4.59, 5.27] for DA cyan and
4.02 dB [3.63, 4.42] for DA red testing. Partial addition of
patient-specific sensitivity data decreased the cross-validated
MAE to 2.8 dB [2.51, 3.09], 3.71 dB [3.46, 3.96], and 2.85 dB
[2.62, 3.08]. The most important predictive feature was outer
nuclear layer thickness. This artificial intelligence-based
analysis strategy, termed ``inferred sensitivity'', herein,
enables to estimate differential effects of retinal structural
abnormalities on cone- and rod-function in nAMD, and may be used
as quasi-functional surrogate endpoint in future clinical
trials.},
