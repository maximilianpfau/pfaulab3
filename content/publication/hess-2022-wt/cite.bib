 abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to quantify choriocapillaris
(CC) flow alterations in early Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD) and
to investigate the relationship of the CC flow deficits with the
choroidal and outer retinal microstructure. METHODS: In this
prospective case-control study, 18 eyes of 11 patients with
early SFD and 31 eyes of 31 controls without ocular pathology
underwent multimodal imaging, including spectral-domain optical
coherence tomography (OCT), followed by deep-learning-based
layer segmentation. OCT angiography (OCTA) was performed to
quantify CC flow signal deficits (FDs). Differences in CC FD
density between SFD patients and controls were determined, and
the relationships with choroidal thickness, retinal pigment
epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC) thickness and outer retinal
layer thicknesses were analyzed using mixed-model analysis.
RESULTS: SFD patients exhibited a significantly greater CC FD
density than controls (estimate [95% CI]: +20.0%FD [13.3;
26.7], p < 0.001 for SFD patients), even when adjusted for age.
Square-root transformed choroidal thickness was a structural OCT
surrogate of the CC FD density (-2.1%FD per $√$µm, p <
0.001), whereas RPEDC thickness was not informative regarding CC
FD (p = 0.061). The CC FD density was associated with an altered
microstructure of the overlying photoreceptors (outer segments,
inner segments, and outer nuclear layer thinning of -0.19
$μ$m, -0.08 $μ$m and -0.30 $μ$m per %FD, respectively,
all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early SFD exhibit
pronounced abnormalities of CC flow signal on OCTA, which are
not limited to areas of sub-RPE deposits seen on OCT imaging.
Thus, analysis of the CC flow may enable clinical trials at
earlier disease stages in SFD.},
