abstract: "PURPOSE: To determine the retest variability of mesopic and two-color dark-adapted
  (DA) fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP), to evaluate the predictive value of patient
  reliability indices, and to analyze the extent of impairment of rod- and cone function
  in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). METHODS: A total of 50 eyes
  of 50 patients with nAMD (mean age, 76.1 years) and 70 eyes of 70 age-similar normal
  subjects underwent multimodal imaging as well as mesopic and DA two-color perimetry
  using the S-MAIA device. A subset of patients (n = 28) underwent duplicate testing
  for retest reliability assessment. Mixed models were used for analysis of the hierarchical
  data. RESULTS: In eyes with nAMD, the coefficient of repeatability was (mean $±$
  standard deviation [SD]) 5.99 $±$ 1.55 dB for mesopic, 6.14 $±$ 2.19 dB for DA cyan,
  and 6.06 $±$ 1.09 dB for DA red testing. ``Patient reliability indices'' explained
  55%, 54.2%, and 64.2% of the variance in retest variability. The mean sensitivity
  loss was greater for DA cyan compared to DA red testing (cyan-red differences [mean
  $±$ SD] -2.63 $±$ 3.87 dB, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The relatively greater degree
  of DA cyan versus DA red sensitivity loss indicates preferential rod vulnerability
  in nAMD, and qualifies rod function-based outcomes measures as potential sensitive
  and early markers of treatment response in nAMD. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The S-MAIA
  allows reliable testing of mesopic, DA cyan, and DA red sensitivity in patients
  with nAMD. Patient reliability indices may serve as eligibility criteria for clinical
  trials to identify patients with adequate retest reliability."
