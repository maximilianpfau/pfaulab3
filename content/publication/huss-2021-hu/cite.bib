 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: For ophthalmologic research, the systematic
correlation of clinical data with data obtained from postmortem
tissue donation is of great benefit. In this respect, the
establishment of an eye donation registry represents a
prerequisite for the acquisition of such data. METHODS: A total
of 300 patients were interviewed at a tertiary referral center
in Germany by means of a standardized questionnaire. Binary
questions were evaluated by percentage; Likert-scaled questions
(1 = does apply; 5 = does not apply) were analyzed by the median
and 25th (Q25) and 75th (Q75) percentiles. RESULTS: The majority
of patients (77.0%) would agree to donate their eyes for
research purposes. When asked about reasons against an eye
donation, 60.9% of all patients only stated reasons in the
category ``addressable'' (e.g., not enough awareness of the
topic). The vast majority of patients considered it appropriate
for an ophthalmologist to approach them on the issue of
postmortem eye donation (median 1, Q25 1, Q75 1). CONCLUSION:
Overall, patients had a positive attitude towards postmortem eye
donation for research purposes. Importantly, reasons given
against postmortem eye donation were often related to
misconceptions and were potentially addressable. These results
underline the fundamental willingness of ophthalmological
patients in Germany to donate their eyes postmortem for research
purposes.},
