 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the involvement of the retinal and
choriocapillaris microvasculature in intermediate uveitis on
optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). DESIGN:
Case-control study. METHODS: Patients and age-matched controls
were imaged with swept-source OCT-A. Using ImageJ, superficial
and deep retinal vasculature were semi-automatically analyzed
for vessel (VD) and skeleton density (SD), vessel diameter index
(VDI), and fractal dimension (FD). Choriocapillaris layer was
automatically graded for mean signal intensity, signal intensity
standard deviation, kurtosis of signal intensity distribution,
and flow signal voids. RESULTS: Twenty-nine intermediate uveitis
eyes and 30 control eyes were included. Both superficial and
deep retinal layers showed significant reduction in all OCT-A
parameters (eg, superficial retinal layer: 0.31 vs 0.40 VD,
5.6e-8 vs 6.4e-8 SD, 5.4e6 vs 6.1e6 VDI, and 1.78 vs 1.79 FD,
respectively, all P < .05). At the choriocapillaris layer a
greater heterogeneity of perfusion with a shift toward a higher
proportion of large confluent flow signal voids was present.
Also in the absence of macular edema OCT-A parameters were
reduced when compared with healthy controls (all parameters
except for VDI in the superficial retinal layer and the
choriocapillaris kurtosis and flow signal void analyses).
CONCLUSIONS: In intermediate uveitis, reduced vascular density
and complexity in superficial as well as deep retinal layers and
altered choriocapillaris perfusion are present. Moreover, these
findings indicate impairment of the macular microvasculature
even in the absence of macular edema. The results of our study
may aid in the diagnosis as well as the monitoring of
intermediate uveitis.},
