 abstract = {Purpose: To examine longitudinal changes of retinal thickness
and retinal sensitivity in patients with intermediate
age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) and predominantly
reticular pseudodrusen (RPD). Methods: At baseline 30 eyes of 25
iAMD patients underwent optical coherence tomography imaging,
mesopic and scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) with
follow-up examinations at month 12 (20 eyes), 24 (12 eyes), and
36 (11 eyes). Thicknesses of different retinal layers and
results of FCP testing (n = 56 stimuli) were spatially and
longitudinally analyzed using linear mixed-effects models.
Results: At baseline, the thickness of the partial outer retinal
layer (pORL, 70.21 vs. 77.47 Âµm) and both mesopic (16.60 vs.
18.72 dB) and scotopic (12.14 vs. 18.67 dB) retinal sensitivity
were decreased in areas with RPD compared with unremarkable
areas (P < 0.001). Over three years, mean change of pORL was
-0.66 normative standard deviation (SD; i.e., z-score, P <
0.001) for regions with existing RPD, -0.40 SD (P < 0.001) for
regions with new occurring RPD, and -0.17 SD (P = 0.041) in
unremarkable regions. Decrease of scotopic and mesopic
sensitivity over three years was more pronounced in areas with
existing (-3.51 and -7.76 dB) and new occurring RPD (-2.06 and
-5.97 dB). Structure-function analysis revealed that 1 SD
decrease of pORL thickness was associated with a sensitivity
reduction of 3.47 dB in scotopic and 0.79 dB in mesopic testing.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates progressive outer retinal
degeneration and impairment of photoreceptor function in eyes
with iAMD and RPD over three years. Preservation of outer
retinal thickness and reduction of RPD formation may constitute
meaningful surrogate endpoints in interventional trials on eyes
with AMD and RPD aiming to slow outer retinal degeneration.},
