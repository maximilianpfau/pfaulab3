 abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate dark adaptation (DA) in patients with
macular telangiectasia Type 2 (MacTel). METHODS: After a local
photobleach (4 $\times$ 4° size, 83% bleach), DA was measured
using a test stimulus (2° diameter) projected at 5° eccentricity
horizontal from the foveal center within the temporal parafovea.
Cone plateau, rod intercept time, and rod recovery rate (S2)
were calculated from the resulting DA curves. Findings were
correlated with disease stages (according to Gass and Blodi),
the area of ellipsoid zone loss in optical coherence tomography,
and macular pigment loss (``MP-Classes 1-3''). RESULTS:
Fifty-nine eyes of 59 patients were compared with 18 eyes of 18
healthy controls. Dark adaptation was significantly impaired in
patients with MacTel. Although differences were most pronounced
for parameters indicating rod-mediated recovery, cone-mediated
recovery was also decreased, yet to a lesser extent. Dark
adaptation parameters were only weakly associated with disease
stages and ellipsoid zone loss. A better association was found
between rod-mediated recovery (S2 and rod intercept time) and
macular pigment loss (Kendall's tau for rod intercept time: 0.69
and S2: -0.51; both P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Dark adaptation is
significantly impaired in patients with MacTel. Our results
indicate an association of reduced macular pigment and rod
dysfunction in MacTel.},
