abstract: "PURPOSE: To evaluate dark adaptation (DA) in patients with macular telangiectasia
  Type 2 (MacTel). METHODS: After a local photobleach (4 $times$ 4° size, 83% bleach),
  DA was measured using a test stimulus (2° diameter) projected at 5° eccentricity
  horizontal from the foveal center within the temporal parafovea. Cone plateau, rod
  intercept time, and rod recovery rate (S2) were calculated from the resulting DA
  curves. Findings were correlated with disease stages (according to Gass and Blodi),
  the area of ellipsoid zone loss in optical coherence tomography, and macular pigment
  loss (``MP-Classes 1-3''). RESULTS: Fifty-nine eyes of 59 patients were compared
  with 18 eyes of 18 healthy controls. Dark adaptation was significantly impaired
  in patients with MacTel. Although differences were most pronounced for parameters
  indicating rod-mediated recovery, cone-mediated recovery was also decreased, yet
  to a lesser extent. Dark adaptation parameters were only weakly associated with
  disease stages and ellipsoid zone loss. A better association was found between rod-mediated
  recovery (S2 and rod intercept time) and macular pigment loss (Kendall's tau for
  rod intercept time: 0.69 and S2: -0.51; both P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Dark adaptation
  is significantly impaired in patients with MacTel. Our results indicate an association
  of reduced macular pigment and rod dysfunction in MacTel."
