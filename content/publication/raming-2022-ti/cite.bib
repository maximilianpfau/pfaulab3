 abstract = {PURPOSE: To elucidate morphological determinants of rod and cone
dysfunction in Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD), and to
systematically compare visual function tests for interventional
trials. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS:
Patients with SFD (n = 16) and controls (n = 20) underwent
visual function testing (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] and
low luminance visual acuity [LLVA], contrast sensitivity,
mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) fundus-controlled perimetry [FCP],
rod-mediated dark adaptation [RMDA]), and multimodal imaging.
Vision-related quality of life was evaluated. FCP and RMDA
thresholds were analyzed using mixed models and
structure-function correlation using machine learning (ML).
Longitudinal data of 1 patient with high-dose vitamin A
supplementation were available. RESULTS: Although photopic BCVA
was normative in SFD, LLVA was impaired (0.30 LogMAR [0.20;
0.45] vs 0.20 LogMAR [0.03; 0.28], P < .05). Scotopic visual
function exhibited a delayed rod-intercept time (21 minutes
[12.15; 21] vs 4.05 minutes [3.22; 5.36], P < .001), and marked
DA cyan mean sensitivity loss (-11.80 dB [-3.47; -19.85]),
paralleled by a reduced vision-related quality of life. ML-based
structure-function correlation allowed prediction of mesopic, DA
cyan, and red sensitivity with high accuracy (cross-validated
mean absolute error: 4.36, 7.77, and 5.31 dB, respectively),
whereas RMDA could be slowed even in the absence of fundus
alterations on multimodal imaging. After high-dose vitamin A
supplementation, RMDA and DA thresholds improved markedly.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SFD exhibit severely impaired
scotopic visual function even in the absence of funduscopic
alterations on multimodal imaging. In contrast to BCVA, scotopic
visual function tests are suitable to quantify dysfunction in
the early stages. Improvement of scotopic dysfunction after
(off-label) high-dose vitamin A intake, as observed in one
patient in our study, is compatible with the hypothesized local
deficiency of vitamin A secondary to Bruch's membrane
alterations.},
