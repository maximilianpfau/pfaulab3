abstract: "PURPOSE: To elucidate morphological determinants of rod and cone dysfunction
  in Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD), and to systematically compare visual function
  tests for interventional trials. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS:
  Patients with SFD (n = 16) and controls (n = 20) underwent visual function testing
  (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] and low luminance visual acuity [LLVA], contrast
  sensitivity, mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) fundus-controlled perimetry [FCP], rod-mediated
  dark adaptation [RMDA]), and multimodal imaging. Vision-related quality of life
  was evaluated. FCP and RMDA thresholds were analyzed using mixed models and structure-function
  correlation using machine learning (ML). Longitudinal data of 1 patient with high-dose
  vitamin A supplementation were available. RESULTS: Although photopic BCVA was normative
  in SFD, LLVA was impaired (0.30 LogMAR [0.20; 0.45] vs 0.20 LogMAR [0.03; 0.28],
  P < .05). Scotopic visual function exhibited a delayed rod-intercept time (21 minutes
  [12.15; 21] vs 4.05 minutes [3.22; 5.36], P < .001), and marked DA cyan mean sensitivity
  loss (-11.80 dB [-3.47; -19.85]), paralleled by a reduced vision-related quality
  of life. ML-based structure-function correlation allowed prediction of mesopic,
  DA cyan, and red sensitivity with high accuracy (cross-validated mean absolute error:
  4.36, 7.77, and 5.31 dB, respectively), whereas RMDA could be slowed even in the
  absence of fundus alterations on multimodal imaging. After high-dose vitamin A supplementation,
  RMDA and DA thresholds improved markedly. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SFD exhibit
  severely impaired scotopic visual function even in the absence of funduscopic alterations
  on multimodal imaging. In contrast to BCVA, scotopic visual function tests are suitable
  to quantify dysfunction in the early stages. Improvement of scotopic dysfunction
  after (off-label) high-dose vitamin A intake, as observed in one patient in our
  study, is compatible with the hypothesized local deficiency of vitamin A secondary
  to Bruch's membrane alterations."
