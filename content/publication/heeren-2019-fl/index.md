abstract: "Purpose: Macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) is a bilateral neurodegenerative
  disorder of the central macula. Previous findings indicated more functional impairment
  in low light conditions. We sought to further characterize retinal dysfunction using
  dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (``scotopic microperimetry'').
  Methods: Participants of the MacTel Natural History Observation Registry study and
  age-matched healthy controls underwent retinal imaging including dual wavelength
  autofluorescence macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurement. Retinal sensitivity
  was assessed with scotopic microperimetry using cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm).
  Disease was graded into classes of MPOD loss (0 to 3). For perimetry analysis, the
  differences of the mean sensitivities (MacTel minus controls) were compared at each
  test location and the results were aggregated to global indices. Results: Thirty-four
  eyes (19 patients, mean age 62.2 years) were compared with 25 eyes (25 controls,
  mean age 61.5 years). Both cyan and red sensitivity were lower in MacTel. This was
  more pronounced at one- and three-degree eccentricity. Eyes with MPOD class 0 did
  not exhibit a functional deficit. Class 1 had impaired cyan, but normal red sensitivity.
  Class 2 and 3 behaved similarly and had impaired cyan and red sensitivity with a
  relatively higher cyan impairment. Conclusions: Rods might be compromised to a greater
  extent than cones. Linking to previous studies, our results might also hint toward
  (postreceptoral) dysfunction of the cone system in very early disease stages. Macular
  pigment loss and global perimetry indices seemed to reflect functional impairment
  and might be useful as adjunct measures for disease progression."
