 abstract = {Purpose: Macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) is a bilateral
neurodegenerative disorder of the central macula. Previous
findings indicated more functional impairment in low light
conditions. We sought to further characterize retinal
dysfunction using dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled
perimetry (``scotopic microperimetry''). Methods: Participants
of the MacTel Natural History Observation Registry study and
age-matched healthy controls underwent retinal imaging including
dual wavelength autofluorescence macular pigment optical density
(MPOD) measurement. Retinal sensitivity was assessed with
scotopic microperimetry using cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm).
Disease was graded into classes of MPOD loss (0 to 3). For
perimetry analysis, the differences of the mean sensitivities
(MacTel minus controls) were compared at each test location and
the results were aggregated to global indices. Results:
Thirty-four eyes (19 patients, mean age 62.2 years) were
compared with 25 eyes (25 controls, mean age 61.5 years). Both
cyan and red sensitivity were lower in MacTel. This was more
pronounced at one- and three-degree eccentricity. Eyes with MPOD
class 0 did not exhibit a functional deficit. Class 1 had
impaired cyan, but normal red sensitivity. Class 2 and 3 behaved
similarly and had impaired cyan and red sensitivity with a
relatively higher cyan impairment. Conclusions: Rods might be
compromised to a greater extent than cones. Linking to previous
studies, our results might also hint toward (postreceptoral)
dysfunction of the cone system in very early disease stages.
Macular pigment loss and global perimetry indices seemed to
reflect functional impairment and might be useful as adjunct
measures for disease progression.},
