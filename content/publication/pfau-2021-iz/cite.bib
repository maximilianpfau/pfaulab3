 abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the applicability of mesopic light
sensitivity measurements obtained by fundus-controlled perimetry
(FCP, also termed 'microperimetry') as clinical trial endpoint
in Stargardt disease (STGD1). METHODS: In this retrospective,
monocentre cohort study, 271 eyes of 136 patients (age, 37.1
years) with STGD1 and 87 eyes of 54 healthy controls (age, 41.0
years) underwent mesopic FCP, using a pattern of 50 stimuli
(achromatic, 400-800 nm) centred on the fovea. The concurrent
validity of mesopic FCP testing using the MAIA device
(CenterVue, Italy), the retest variability and its determinants,
and the progression of sensitivity loss over time were
investigated using mixed-model analyses. The main outcomes were
the average pointwise sensitivity loss in dependence of
patients' demographic, functional and imaging characteristics,
the intrasession 95% coefficient of repeatability, and the
pointwise sensitivity loss over time. RESULTS: Pointwise
sensitivity loss was on average (estimate (95% CI)) 13.88 dB
(12.55 to 15.21) along the horizontal meridian and was
significantly associated with the electrophysiological subgroup,
presence/absence of foveal sparing, best-corrected visual acuity
and disease duration. The 95% coefficient of repeatability was
12.15 dB (10.78 to 13.38) and varied in dependence of the
underlying mean sensitivity and local sensitivity slope. The
global progression rate for the sensitivity loss was 0.45
dB/year (0.13 to 0.78) and was higher for the central and inner
ETDRS subfields compared with more peripheral regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Mesopic light sensitivity measured by FCP is
reliable and susceptible for functional changes. It constitutes
a potential clinical outcome for both natural history studies as
well as future interventional studies in patients with STGD1.},
