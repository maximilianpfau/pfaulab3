abstract: 'PURPOSE: To determine the intrasession test-retest reliability of mesopic
  and dark-adapted fundus-controlled perimetry in patients with intermediate age-related
  macular degeneration (iAMD). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with
  23 iAMD patients (67.3 $±$ 8.2 years; range, 50-85; 78% female) and 24 healthy controls
  (61.3 $±$ 5.2 years; range, 50-71; 50% female) using a modified MAIA microperimeter.
  All patients underwent duplicate mesopic (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm) and dark-adapted
  (red stimuli, 627 nm) microperimetry, using a grid of 33 stimuli over 14° of the
  central retina. Main outcome measure was the intrasession test-retest reliability
  for pointwise sensitivity (PWS). RESULTS: PWS test-retest reliability was good among
  mesopic and dark-adapted testing in both patients and controls (coefficient of repeatability
  of 4.4, 4.52, 3.96, and 4.56 dB, respectively). Mean mesopic sensitivity in patients
  was 2.62 dB lower than in controls (P < 0.01); mean dark-adapted sensitivity was
  2.49 dB lower than in controls (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The modified MAIA device
  allows for reliable mesopic and dark-adapted microperimetry in iAMD patients. We
  found that iAMD is associated with both reduced mesopic and dark-adapted retinal
  sensitivity.'
