 abstract = {PURPOSE: To genetically characterize a subphenotype of geographic
atrophy (GA) in AMD associated with rapid progression and a
diffuse-trickling appearance on fundus autofluorescence imaging.
METHODS: Patients from the Fundus Autofluorescence in Age-Related
Macular Degeneration Study were phenotyped for diffuse-trickling
GA (dt-GA; n = 44). DNA was analyzed for 10 known AMD-associated
genetic variants. A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated and
compared with patients with nondiffuse-trickling GA (ndt-GA; n =
311) and individuals from the 1000 genomes project (1000G; n =
267). Given the phenotypic overlap between diffuse-trickling and
late-onset retinal degeneration (LORD), all C1QTNF5 exons and
their exon/intron boundaries were sequenced. RESULTS: A
statistically significant difference in allele frequencies
between dt-GA and ndt-GA were found for CFH:rs1061170 and
CFH:rs800292 (Pcorrected = 0.03). The ARMS2 variant rs10490924
was significantly more frequent in dt-GA than in 1000G
individuals (Pcorrected < 0.01). The GRS of dt-GA patients was
in-between the score of the 1000G individuals and that of
patients with ndt-GA, significantly differing from both
(Pcorrected <0.01). Sequencing of C1QTNF5 revealed 28 unique
variants although none showed a statistically significant
association with dt-GA when compared with 1000G individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: The dt-GA phenotype shows a remarkably different
genetic risk profile from other GA phenotypes secondary to AMD.
Disease-associated C1QTNF5 mutations were not identified.
Together, these results suggest that the dt-GA phenotype is
associated with a genetic background substantially different from
other GA phenotypes and underlines the necessity to refine the
clinical phenotyping, specifically when aiming for individualized
therapies in AMD.},
