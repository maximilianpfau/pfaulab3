 abstract = {AIMS: To identify morphological characteristics preceding the
development of exudative neovascularisation secondary to Macular
Telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) using multimodal retinal imaging.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, eyes with a minimum
observation period of 6 months prior to the de novo diagnosis of
an exudative neovascularisation secondary to MacTel were
analysed. Morphological changes preceding the formation of
neovascularisation were evaluated using colour fundus
photography, infrared imaging, fluorescein angiography, macular
pigment measurement and optical coherence tomography (OCT).
OCT-angiography (OCT-A) images were additionally available in a
subset of patients. RESULTS: Twenty eyes from 20 patients were
examined over a median period of 17 months (range: 6-100
months). Eyes were characterised by an accelerated progression
of ellipsoid zone loss (median of 0.013 mm2/month), increased
thickness of the temporal parafovea and hyper-reflective lesions
on OCT. The latter underwent morphological changes preceding the
development of exudative neovascularisation, including an
increase in size and density, and expansion to outer retinal
layers and the retinal pigment epithelium. All eyes showed a
foveal depletion of macular pigment. On OCT-A, a focal increase
in blood flow was observed at the level of the outer
retina/choriocapillaris, and retinal-retinal and
retinal-choroidal anastomoses preceded the formation of
exudative neovascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal imaging
allows the identification of prognostic morphological features
preceding the formation of exudative neovascularisation in
MacTel. Eyes exhibiting these characteristics should be
monitored closely and patients should be alert for emergent
symptoms in order to detect and treat neovascularisation early
and, thereby, prevent irreversible visual loss.},
