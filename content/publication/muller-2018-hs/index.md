abstract: 'Purpose: To investigate the choroidal blood flow in areas within and adjacent
  to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy secondary to late-onset Stargardt disease
  (STGD1) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: A total of 43 eyes
  (23 STGD1 and 20 AMD) of patients with RPE atrophy and 25 eyes of healthy controls
  without ocular pathology underwent multimodal imaging including optical coherence
  tomography angiography (OCT-A; PLEX Elite 9000 Swept-Source OCT). Using an exploratory
  approach, choriocapillaris and deeper choroid OCT-A slabs were evaluated in order
  to detect differences between STGD1 and AMD. The magnitude of absence-of-flow signal
  (AFS) was investigated in terms of area-fraction and size-frequency distribution.
  Results: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of areas of RPE atrophy revealed
  more pronounced rarefaction of the choriocapillaris flow signal in STGD1 as compared
  to AMD (AFS area fraction: 33.15% $±$ 6.86% vs. 31.68% $±$ 8.39%; P = 0.517), while
  outside RPE atrophy rarefaction was less pronounced in STGD1 (AFS area fraction:
  17.41% $±$ 5.67% vs. 21.59% $±$ 6.90%; P < 0.001), to the level of nonsignificance
  compared to controls (13.27% $±$ 2.99%, P = 0.368). Given this discrepancy, the
  ratio of the AFS area fraction within/outside of RPE atrophy could be used to differentiate
  between STGD1 and AMD with 65.0% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity. Conclusions:
  Using OCT-A, comparison of choroidal flow signal within and outside the area of
  RPE atrophy revealed distinct differences between STGD1 and AMD, potentially implicating
  a differential role of the choroid in the pathogenesis of RPE atrophy in these two
  diseases.'
