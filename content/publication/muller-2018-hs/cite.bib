 abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the choroidal blood flow in areas within
and adjacent to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy
secondary to late-onset Stargardt disease (STGD1) and
age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: A total of 43
eyes (23 STGD1 and 20 AMD) of patients with RPE atrophy and 25
eyes of healthy controls without ocular pathology underwent
multimodal imaging including optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCT-A; PLEX Elite 9000 Swept-Source OCT). Using an
exploratory approach, choriocapillaris and deeper choroid OCT-A
slabs were evaluated in order to detect differences between
STGD1 and AMD. The magnitude of absence-of-flow signal (AFS) was
investigated in terms of area-fraction and size-frequency
distribution. Results: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of
areas of RPE atrophy revealed more pronounced rarefaction of the
choriocapillaris flow signal in STGD1 as compared to AMD (AFS
area fraction: 33.15% $±$ 6.86% vs. 31.68% $±$ 8.39%; P
= 0.517), while outside RPE atrophy rarefaction was less
pronounced in STGD1 (AFS area fraction: 17.41% $±$ 5.67% vs.
21.59% $±$ 6.90%; P < 0.001), to the level of
nonsignificance compared to controls (13.27% $±$ 2.99%, P =
0.368). Given this discrepancy, the ratio of the AFS area
fraction within/outside of RPE atrophy could be used to
differentiate between STGD1 and AMD with 65.0% sensitivity and
92.3% specificity. Conclusions: Using OCT-A, comparison of
choroidal flow signal within and outside the area of RPE atrophy
revealed distinct differences between STGD1 and AMD, potentially
implicating a differential role of the choroid in the
pathogenesis of RPE atrophy in these two diseases.},
