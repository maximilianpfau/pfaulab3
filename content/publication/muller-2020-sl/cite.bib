 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic value of demographic,
functional, and imaging parameters on retinal pigment epithelium
(RPE) atrophy progression secondary to maternally inherited
diabetes and deafness (MIDD) and to evaluate the application of
these factors in clinical trial design. DESIGN: Retrospective
observational case series. METHODS: Thirty-five eyes of 20
patients (age range, 24.9-75.9 years) with genetically proven
MIDD and demarcated RPE atrophy on serial fundus
autofluorescence (AF) images were included. Lesion size and
shape-descriptive parameters were longitudinally determined by 2
independent readers. A linear mixed-effect model was used to
predict the lesion enlargement rate based on baseline variables.
Sample size calculations were performed to model the power in a
simulated interventional study. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time
was 4.27 years. The mean progression rate of RPE atrophy was
2.33 mm2/year, revealing a dependence on baseline lesion size
(+0.04 [0.02-0.07] mm2/year/mm2, P < .001), which was absent
after square root transformation. The fovea was preserved in the
majority of patients during the observation time. In the case of
foveal involvement, the loss of visual acuity lagged behind
central RPE atrophy in AF images. Sex, age, and number of
atrophic foci predicted future progression rates with a
cross-validated mean absolute error of 0.13 mm/year and to
reduce the required sample size for simulated interventional
trials. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive RPE atrophy could be traced in
all eyes using AF imaging. Shape-descriptive factors and
patients' baseline characteristics had significant prognostic
value, guiding appropriate subject selection and sample size in
future interventional trial design.},
