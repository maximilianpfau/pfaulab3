abstract: "PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic value of demographic, functional,
  and imaging parameters on retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy progression secondary
  to maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) and to evaluate the application
  of these factors in clinical trial design. DESIGN: Retrospective observational case
  series. METHODS: Thirty-five eyes of 20 patients (age range, 24.9-75.9 years) with
  genetically proven MIDD and demarcated RPE atrophy on serial fundus autofluorescence
  (AF) images were included. Lesion size and shape-descriptive parameters were longitudinally
  determined by 2 independent readers. A linear mixed-effect model was used to predict
  the lesion enlargement rate based on baseline variables. Sample size calculations
  were performed to model the power in a simulated interventional study. RESULTS:
  The mean follow-up time was 4.27 years. The mean progression rate of RPE atrophy
  was 2.33 mm2/year, revealing a dependence on baseline lesion size (+0.04 [0.02-0.07]
  mm2/year/mm2, P < .001), which was absent after square root transformation. The
  fovea was preserved in the majority of patients during the observation time. In
  the case of foveal involvement, the loss of visual acuity lagged behind central
  RPE atrophy in AF images. Sex, age, and number of atrophic foci predicted future
  progression rates with a cross-validated mean absolute error of 0.13 mm/year and
  to reduce the required sample size for simulated interventional trials. CONCLUSIONS:
  Progressive RPE atrophy could be traced in all eyes using AF imaging. Shape-descriptive
  factors and patients' baseline characteristics had significant prognostic value,
  guiding appropriate subject selection and sample size in future interventional trial
  design."
