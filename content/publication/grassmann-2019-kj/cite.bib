 abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common
threat to vision loss in individuals older than 50 years. While
neovascular complications in AMD are treatable, there is
currently no therapy for geographic atrophy secondary to AMD.
Geographic atrophy lesion progression over time shows
considerable interindividual variability, but little is known
about prognostic factors. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the
contribution of common genetic variants to geographic atrophy
lesion growth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pooled
analysis combined 4 independent studies: the Fundus
Autofluorescence Imaging in Age-Related Macular Degeneration
(FAM) study, the Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy (DSGA)
study, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), and the
Geographic Atrophy Treatment Evaluation (GATE) study. Each
provided data for geographic atrophy lesion growth in specific
designs. Patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD were
recruited to these studies. Genotypes were retrieved through the
database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (for AREDS) or generated at
the Cologne Center for Genomics (for FAM, DSGA, and GATE). MAIN
OUTCOMES: The correlation between square root-transformed
geographic atrophy growth rate and 7 596 219 genetic variants
passing quality control was estimated using linear regression.
The calculations were adjusted for known factors influencing
geographic atrophy growth, such as the presence of bilateral
geographic atrophy as well as the number of lesion spots and
follow-up times. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Slopes per allele,
95% CIs, and P values of genetic variants correlated with
geographic atrophy lesion growth. RESULTS: A total of 935
patients (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [7.8] years; 547 female
participants [59.0%]) were included. Two gene loci with
conservative genome-wide significance were identified. Each
minor allele of the genome-wide associated variants increased
the geographic atrophy growth rate by a mean of about 15% or
0.05 mm per year. Gene prioritization within each locus suggests
the protein arginine methyltransferase 6 gene (PRMT6; chromosome
1; slope, 0.046 [95% CI, 0.026-0.066]; P = 4.09 $\times$ 10-8)
and the lanosterol synthase gene (LSS; chromosome 21; slope,
0.105 [95% CI, 0.068-0.143]; P = 4.07 $\times$ 10-7) as the
most likely progression-associated genes. CONCLUSIONS AND
RELEVANCE: These data provide further insight into the genetic
architecture of geographic atrophy lesion growth. Geographic
atrophy is a clinical outcome with a high medical need for
effective therapy. The genes PRMT6 and LSS are promising
candidates for future studies aimed at understanding functional
aspects of geographic atrophy progression and also for designing
novel and targeted treatment options.},
