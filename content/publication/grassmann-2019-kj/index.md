abstract: 'IMPORTANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common threat to
  vision loss in individuals older than 50 years. While neovascular complications
  in AMD are treatable, there is currently no therapy for geographic atrophy secondary
  to AMD. Geographic atrophy lesion progression over time shows considerable interindividual
  variability, but little is known about prognostic factors. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate
  the contribution of common genetic variants to geographic atrophy lesion growth.
  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pooled analysis combined 4 independent studies:
  the Fundus Autofluorescence Imaging in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (FAM) study,
  the Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy (DSGA) study, the Age-Related Eye Disease
  Study (AREDS), and the Geographic Atrophy Treatment Evaluation (GATE) study. Each
  provided data for geographic atrophy lesion growth in specific designs. Patients
  with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD were recruited to these studies. Genotypes
  were retrieved through the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (for AREDS) or generated
  at the Cologne Center for Genomics (for FAM, DSGA, and GATE). MAIN OUTCOMES: The
  correlation between square root-transformed geographic atrophy growth rate and 7
  596 219 genetic variants passing quality control was estimated using linear regression.
  The calculations were adjusted for known factors influencing geographic atrophy
  growth, such as the presence of bilateral geographic atrophy as well as the number
  of lesion spots and follow-up times. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Slopes per allele,
  95% CIs, and P values of genetic variants correlated with geographic atrophy lesion
  growth. RESULTS: A total of 935 patients (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [7.8] years; 547 female
  participants [59.0%]) were included. Two gene loci with conservative genome-wide
  significance were identified. Each minor allele of the genome-wide associated variants
  increased the geographic atrophy growth rate by a mean of about 15% or 0.05 mm per
  year. Gene prioritization within each locus suggests the protein arginine methyltransferase
  6 gene (PRMT6; chromosome 1; slope, 0.046 [95% CI, 0.026-0.066]; P = 4.09 $times$
  10-8) and the lanosterol synthase gene (LSS; chromosome 21; slope, 0.105 [95% CI,
  0.068-0.143]; P = 4.07 $times$ 10-7) as the most likely progression-associated genes.
  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data provide further insight into the genetic architecture
  of geographic atrophy lesion growth. Geographic atrophy is a clinical outcome with
  a high medical need for effective therapy. The genes PRMT6 and LSS are promising
  candidates for future studies aimed at understanding functional aspects of geographic
  atrophy progression and also for designing novel and targeted treatment options.'
