abstract: 'Purpose: To longitudinally evaluate vision-related quality of life (VRQoL)
  in geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and
  define its relation to visual function and structural biomarkers. Methods: Patients
  with GA secondary to AMD were recruited in the context of the prospective, non-interventional,
  natural-history Directional Spread in Geographic-Atrophy study (NCT02051998). Fundus
  autofluorescence and infrared reflectance images were semi-automatically annotated
  for GA. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to investigate the association
  of putative determinants with the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire
  25 (NEI VFQ-25) VRQoL. Results: A total of 87 patients with a mean age $±$ SD of
  77.07 $±$ 7.49 years were included in the analysis. At baseline, median (IQR) best-corrected
  visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.3 (0.51) for the better eye and 0.89 (0.76) for the worse
  eye; 46% of the patients showed binocular and 25.3% monocular non-central GA. The
  VRQoL composite score was impaired: 69.96 (24.03). Sixty-six patients with a median
  of 2 (2) follow-up visits after 1.08 (0.78) years were examined longitudinally.
  Conclusions: Vision-related quality of life is significantly impaired in patients
  with GA secondary to AMD. The cross-sectional and longitudinal association of VRQoL
  with visual functional and structural biomarkers supports the validity of the NEI
  VFQ-25 VRQoL.'
