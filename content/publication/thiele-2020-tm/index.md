abstract: 'PURPOSE: To analyze longitudinal thickness changes of retinal layers in
  comparison with established risk factors in eyes with age-related macular degeneration
  (AMD) with regard to their prognostic value for conversion into advanced AMD stages.
  DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal natural history study. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-one
  eyes of 91 patients with AMD (73.3$±$7.3 years; 62 female patients [50.4%]) of the
  Molecular Diagnostic of Age-related Macular Degeneration (MODIAMD) study without
  exudative or nonexudative late-stage AMD in the study eye at baseline. METHODS:
  At each annual follow-up visit, all subjects underwent ophthalmic examination with
  assessment of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and retinal imaging, including
  spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT), over a study period of 6 years. PURPOSE: To analyze
  longitudinal thickness changes of retinal layers in comparison with established
  risk factors in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with regard to
  their prognostic value for conversion into advanced AMD stages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
  Qualitative structural AMD features and SD-OCT-based quantitative thickness changes
  of different retinal layers, such as the retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex
  (RPEDC), were assessed by multimodal imaging. Their prognostic relevance regarding
  disease conversion was determined using Cox regression (cloglog link function).
  RESULTS: In the multivariable analysis, the presence of focal hyperpigmentation,
  almost reaching statistical significance, showed the strongest effect regarding
  the development of nonexudative late-stage AMD (hazard ratio [HR], 5.88; 95% confidence
  interval [CI], 0.69-50.2; P = 0.052) followed by the presence of refractile drusen
  (HR, 4.82; 95% CI, 1.33-17.44; P = 0.0164). A thickening of the RPEDC was the only
  assessed retinal layer that exhibited a significant effect on the development of
  nonexudative advanced AMD (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.0-1.07; P = 0.0393), whereas no association
  was observable for the other retinal layers. Neither qualitative nor quantitative
  markers were significant predictors for the development of exudative late-stage
  AMD (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the development of both exudative
  and nonexudative AMD is associated with distinct prognostic features. However, compared
  with the assessment of qualitative AMD features, the quantification of retinal layers
  on average across the central retina had less prognostic impact. Further studies
  are needed to identify and validate robust biomarkers in early AMD stages.'
