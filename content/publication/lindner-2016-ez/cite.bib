 abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the potential of optical coherence
tomography (OCT) angiography to detect and quantify the
neovascular network in exudative AMD. Methods:
Treatment-naı̈ve eyes that were diagnosed with exudative AMD
were prospectively examined by OCT angiography (OCT-A). The
extent of the neovascular network was measured by three
independent readers. Interclass-correlation coefficient and area
overlap coefficients (OC) were calculated to assess locally
precise agreement between measurements. As a reference for
interreader agreement, the extent of the neovascular network was
further measured on fluorescein angiography (FA) images. Results:
A total of 31 eyes (27 patients, mean age 82.5 years, 15 female)
were included in the study. Neovascularization subtype was
classified as type I in 5, type II in 11, type III in 9, and
mixed in 6 eyes, respectively. Interreader agreement for
measurements of the neovascular network was 0.884 for OCT-A and
0.636 for FA. Overlap coefficient was 0.705 (interquartile [IQR]:
0.450-0.76) for OCT-A and 0.704 (IQR: 0.673-0.750) for FA,
respectively. Area agreement was weaker in type III and mixed
lesions. Conclusions: Optical coherence tomography
angiography-based measurements of the new vessel complex in
neovascular AMD are feasible with interreader agreement
comparable with the values obtained for FA. The results
underscore the potential of OCT-A as a noninvasive diagnostic
tool in neovascular AMD. Yet, further studies will be required to
reveal the origin of poor agreement observed in single eyes and
to advance OCT-A toward dependable use (e.g., in a reading center
context).},
