 abstract = {Purpose: The aim of the study was to visualize and to quantify
pathological foveal avascular zone (FAZ) alterations through
optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) in eyes with
retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in comparison to the unaffected
fellow eyes. Procedures: OCT-A was conducted with the
Avanti® RTVue 100 XR system (Optovue Inc.,
Fremont, Calif., USA). The borders of the superficial vascular
layer (SVL) were defined as 3 $μ$m below the internal limiting
membrane and 15 $μ$m below the inner plexiform layer, and for
the deep vascular layer (DVL) as 15 and 70 $μ$m below the
inner plexiform layer, respectively. The length of the
horizontal, vertical and maximum FAZ was manually measured for
the SVL and DVL in each eye. Additionally, the angle between the
maximum FAZ diameter and the papillomacular plane was measured.
Results: OCT-A depicted defects within the perifoveal
vasculature in eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO; n
= 11) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO; n = 8). These
resulted in an enlargement of the maximum FAZ diameter in eyes
with RVO (n = 19) in comparison to the healthy fellow eyes (n =
19; 921 $±$ 213 vs. 724 $±$ 145 µm; p = 0.008). Furthermore,
a significant correlation was found between best-corrected
visual acuity (BCVA) and the maximum FAZ diameter in the DVL
