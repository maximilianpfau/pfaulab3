abstract: 'BACKGROUND/AIMS: To analyse the retest reliability of visual field indices
  and to describe patterns of visual field deficits in mesopic and dark-adapted two-colour
  fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in macular diseases. METHODS: Seventy-seven eyes
  (30 eyes with macular diseases and 47 normal eyes) underwent duplicate mesopic and
  dark-adapted two-colour FCP (Scotopic Macular Integrity Assessment, CenterVue).
  Non-weighted (mean defect, loss variance), variability-weighted (mean deviation,
  pattern standard deviation (PSD)) and graphical (cumulative defect (Bebie) curves)
  indices were computed. Reproducibility (coefficient of repeatability, CoR) of these
  indices was assessed. Cluster analysis was carried out to identify patterns of visual
  field deficits. RESULTS: The intrasession reproducibility was lower for the mean
  defect as compared with the mean deviation (CoR (dB) 2.67 vs 2.57 for mesopic, 1.71
  vs 1.45 for dark-adapted cyan, 1.94 vs 1.87 for dark-adapted red testing) and lower
  for the square-root loss variance as compared with the PSD (CoR (dB) 1.48 vs 1.34,
  0.77 vs 0.65, 1.23 vs 1.03). Hierarchical cluster analysis of the indices disclosed
  six patterns of visual field deficits (approximately unbiased P value>0.95) with
  varying degrees of global versus focal defect and rod versus cone dysfunction. These
  were also reflected by the cumulative defect curves. CONCLUSION: FCP with mesopic
  and dark-adapted two-colour testing allows for reproducible assessment of different
  types of retinal sensitivity, whereby mean deviation and PSD exhibited the better
  retest reliability of the tested indices. Distinct patterns of retinal dysfunction
  can be identified using this setup, reflecting variable degrees of rod and cone
  dysfunction in different macular diseases. Dark-adapted two-colour FCP provides
  additional diagnostic information and allows for refined structure-function correlation
  in macular diseases.'
