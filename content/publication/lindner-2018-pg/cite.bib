 abstract = {Purpose: To assess the impact of distinct atrophy border
characteristics based on spectral-domain optical coherence
tomography (SD-OCT) imaging on local atrophy progression.
Methods: Patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to AMD
were recruited in the context of the Longitudinal Fundus
Autofluorescence in Age-related Macular Degeneration and
Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy studies (NCT00393692,
NCT02051998). Horizontal and vertical SD-OCT scans were acquired
at sequential visits using a device allowing for anatomically
accurate registration of follow-up to baseline scans. For
quantification of local atrophy progression, the lateral spread
of GA (LSGA) was measured. Further, border types were
independently graded. Comparison of LSGA between the different
border types was performed using linear mixed-effects models.
Results: Seventy-two eyes of 49 patients (27 female) aged 74.0
years (Inter quartile range [IQR], 68.1-79.0) were included into
this analysis. A total of 258 border sections were analyzed
longitudinally over a median period of 1.2 years (IQR, 0.9-1.6).
At baseline, 17.1% borders were classified as 'regular', 47.7%
as 'irregular', and 35.3% as 'splitting'. Sixty-two percent of
the eyes exhibited more than one border type. LSGA was slowest in
'regular' borders (62.85 $±$ 25.29 $μ$m/y), followed by
'irregular' borders (91.15 $±$ 15.05 $μ$m/y) and fastest in
'splitting' borders (183.15 $±$ 18.17 $μ$m/y). Differences
between the 'splitting' and each other border type were
statistically significant (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The results
indicate that SD-OCT-based assessment of local GA border
morphology can serve as a predictor for local atrophy
progression. These observations help to better understand the
natural history and potential pathogenetic factors of GA
development and progression.},
