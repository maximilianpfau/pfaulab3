 abstract = {Purpose: To investigate structural correlates corresponding to
the appearance of increased fundus autofluorescence (FAF) in the
perilesional area of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to
age-related macular degeneration. Methods: Serial FAF images of
181 eyes with GA of 134 patients participating in the Directional
Spread in Geographic Atrophy study (NCT02051998) were screened
for increased FAF spots that had developed during the review
period. Thickness and reflectivity of the retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE)-basal lamina complex, as well as the integrity
of the external limiting membrane (ELM) and the ellipsoid zone
(EZ), respectively, in corresponding optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans were compared between the time points before and
after the appearance of increased FAF. Adjacent areas without
development of abnormal FAF were assessed as internal control.
Results: A total of 36 areas (15 eyes) with de novo developed
increased FAF spots and 54 control areas were included. Analysis
of the corresponding OCT images revealed an increase in RPE-basal
lamina complex thickness (31.8 $±$ 7.3 to 42.1 $±$ 11.9
$μ$m [P < 0.001]) and reflectivity (reflectivity ratio: 1.42
$±$ 0.11 to 1.54 $±$ 0.27 [P = 0.009]) corresponding to an
increased FAF signal while there was no significant change in
control areas. Development of increased FAF spots was associated
with disruption of the ELM and the EZ. Conclusions: Increase of
RPE-basal lamina complex thickness and reflectivity was spatially
and temporally associated with the development of increased FAF
spots in eyes with GA. In addition, outer retinal disruption may
contribute to the corresponding increased FAF signal.},
