abstract: 'Purpose: To investigate structural correlates corresponding to the appearance
  of increased fundus autofluorescence (FAF) in the perilesional area of geographic
  atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration. Methods: Serial FAF
  images of 181 eyes with GA of 134 patients participating in the Directional Spread
  in Geographic Atrophy study (NCT02051998) were screened for increased FAF spots
  that had developed during the review period. Thickness and reflectivity of the retinal
  pigment epithelium (RPE)-basal lamina complex, as well as the integrity of the external
  limiting membrane (ELM) and the ellipsoid zone (EZ), respectively, in corresponding
  optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans were compared between the time points before
  and after the appearance of increased FAF. Adjacent areas without development of
  abnormal FAF were assessed as internal control. Results: A total of 36 areas (15
  eyes) with de novo developed increased FAF spots and 54 control areas were included.
  Analysis of the corresponding OCT images revealed an increase in RPE-basal lamina
  complex thickness (31.8 $±$ 7.3 to 42.1 $±$ 11.9 $μ$m [P < 0.001]) and reflectivity
  (reflectivity ratio: 1.42 $±$ 0.11 to 1.54 $±$ 0.27 [P = 0.009]) corresponding to
  an increased FAF signal while there was no significant change in control areas.
  Development of increased FAF spots was associated with disruption of the ELM and
  the EZ. Conclusions: Increase of RPE-basal lamina complex thickness and reflectivity
  was spatially and temporally associated with the development of increased FAF spots
  in eyes with GA. In addition, outer retinal disruption may contribute to the corresponding
  increased FAF signal.'
