abstract: 'PURPOSE: To analyze foveal avascular zone (FAZ) dimensions and symmetry
  in patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) compared to healthy controls using optical
  coherence tomography angiography (OCT angiography). METHODS: OCT angiography was
  performed via an Avanti® RTVue 100 XR OCT system (Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA)
  in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and healthy adults. A frame centered on
  the fovea was used for FAZ measurements. The borders of the superficial vascular
  layer were defined as 3 $μ$m below the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and 15 $μ$m
  below the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and for the deep vascular layer as15 $μ$m
  and 70 $μ$m below the IPL, respectively. Angles of maximum FAZ diameter were measured
  in all eyes by two graders. RESULTS: In healthy eyes (N = 25), the FAZ surrounding
  vascular arcades were intact, showing a vertical or horizontal oval symmetrical
  formation with a maximum diameter usually on the horizontal or vertical axis. Diabetic
  eyes (N = 29) presented with disintegrity of the vascular arcades, resulting in
  an enlarged FAZ. In the superficial layer, the mean horizontal FAZ diameter was
  significantly larger in the DR group (753 $μ$m $±$272 $μ$m) than in the control
  group (573 $μ$m $±$177 $μ$m, p = 0.029). The difference was even more pronounced
  in the deep layer, with a mean value of 659 $μ$m $±$194 $μ$m in the control group
  and 1009 $μ$m $±$342 $μ$m in the DR group (p = 0.001). Furthermore, in the superficial
  layer, the angle of the maximum FAZ diameter was 0° ($±$15°) or 90° ($±$15°) in
  72.0 % of healthy eyes. In eyes with DR, the angle was 0° ($±$15°) or 90° ($±$15°)
  in only 6.9 % of cases, due to the irregular configuration of the FAZ. CONCLUSIONS:
  OCT angiography is capable of imaging retinal vasculature without dye injection.
  Our data suggest that it can detect disintegrity of the vascular arcades surrounding
  the FAZ, thus differentiating DM from healthy eyes. Vascular abnormalities were
  more pronounced in the deep vascular layer.'
