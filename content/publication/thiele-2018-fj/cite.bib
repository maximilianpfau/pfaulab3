 abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate two different spectral-domain optical
coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scan patterns in eyes with
intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) for the
longitudinal assessment of drusen volume. METHODS: The data of
38 eyes of 38 AMD patients (age 69.97 $±$ 6.08 years) were
included. The longitudinal drusen volume over 4 years was
analyzed by annual SD-OCT raster scanning (field size 20
$\times$ 15°). Two raster scan patterns (A/B) differed in the
distance between neighboring B-scans (240 vs. 30 µm) and in the
number of averaged frames (4 vs. 15). RESULTS: The mean drusen
volume at baseline was 0.213 $±$ 0.100 mm3 (pattern A) and
0.219 $±$ 0.103 mm3 (pattern B) (p = 0.937). Linear
mixed-effect models showed no significant difference for the
change within 4 years for both pattern A (p = 0.8) and pattern B
(p = 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the
performance of interpolation algorithms may be sufficient to
balance for less dense raster scanning with regard to
quantification of longitudinal drusen volume, which can be used
as a surrogate marker for AMD progression in future clinical
trials.},
