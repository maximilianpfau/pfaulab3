 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To quantify vessel density (VD) and
grey value (GV) as a measure of flow in the choriocapillaris (CC)
in healthy subjects with optical coherence tomography angiography
(OCTA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, noncomparative
case series, 3 mm $\times$ 3 mm OCTA images of 36 eyes of 22
healthy individuals were obtained using a swept-source
instrument. VD and GV levels were calculated on CC en face slabs
in the central 1-mm (subfoveal field) and surrounding 2.5-mm
parafoveal ring. VD was calculated as a ratio of vessel area over
nonvessel area following image binarization. GV was computed as
the mean, un-normalized greyscale intensity value for all pixels
in the region of interest. For each eye, the procedure was
repeated 1 minute to 2 minutes later and intersession
repeatability was analyzed. The choroidal thickness (CT) was
automatically measured in the subfoveal and parafoveal regions
and compared to VD and GV values. RESULTS: The VD ratio and GV
was lower in the subfoveal field than in the parafoveal four
sectors. The intersession intraclass correlation coefficients
were high for both VD and GV measurements. There was no
correlation observed between CT and VD or GV. CONCLUSIONS:
Quantitative metrics can be obtained from CC OCTA en face images.
These values show moderate to good intersession repeatability.
These normative data may be of value as a reference of comparison
in future studies of eyes with disease. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers
