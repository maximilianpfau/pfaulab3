 abstract = {Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) and best corrected visual
acuity (BCVA) measures have been shown to have prognostic value
for recessive Stargardt disease (also called ``ABCA4-related
retinopathy''). These functional tests may serve as a
performance-outcome-measure (PerfO) in emerging interventional
clinical trials, but utility is limited by variability and
patient burden. To address these limitations, an ensemble
machine-learning-based approach was evaluated to differentiate
patients from controls, and predict disease categories depending
on ERG ('inferred ERG') and visual impairment ('inferred visual
impairment') as well as BCVA values ('inferred BCVA') based on
microstructural imaging (utilizing spectral-domain optical
coherence tomography) and patient data. The accuracy for
'inferred ERG' and 'inferred visual impairment' was up to 99.53
$±$ 1.02%. Prediction of BCVA values ('inferred BCVA')
achieved a precision of $±$0.3LogMAR in up to 85.31% of eyes.
Analysis of the permutation importance revealed that foveal
status was the most important feature for BCVA prediction, while
the thickness of outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor inner and
outer segments as well as age of onset highly ranked for all
predictions. 'Inferred ERG', 'inferred visual impairment', and
'inferred BCVA', herein, represent accurate estimates of
differential functional effects of retinal microstructure, and
offer quasi-functional parameters with the potential for a
refined patient assessment, and investigation of potential
future treatment effects or disease progression.},
