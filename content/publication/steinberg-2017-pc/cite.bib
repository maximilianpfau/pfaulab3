 abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare
the MP-1S (Nidek Technologies, Padova, Italy) and the S-MAIA
(CenterVue, Padova, Italy) for mesopic and scotopic
fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in age-related macular
degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Eleven eyes from 11 patients
underwent mesopic and, after 30 minutes of dark adaptation,
scotopic (MP-1S: Goldmann V, 200 ms, background luminance 0.0032
cd/m2; S-MAIA: Goldman III, 200 ms, background luminance <0.0001
cd/m2) FCP. For the S-MAIA device, cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm)
scotopic FCP were performed. For both devices, a grid of 56
stimulus points covering 16° of the central macula was used.
Examination time, fixation stability, and threshold values were
analyzed. RESULTS: The upper end of the dynamic range ($łeq$4 dB
of lowest threshold) was frequently reached by the MP-1S for
mesopic testing (median 34 of 56 stimuli), while threshold values
within the lower 4 dB of the dynamic range were occasionally
found with the S-MAIA for scotopic testing (median 3 for cyan,
median 2 for red). After correction of the stimulus intensity for
the S-MAIA results, the median difference for all stimuli between
both devices for mesopic testing was -2.0 dB (interquartile range
[-4;0], range -14 to 6). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that
robust testing of mesopic and scotopic function is feasible with
both devices in patients with AMD, although both devices are
susceptible to floor and ceiling effects. TRANSLATIONAL
RELEVANCE: The interpretation and particularly the comparison of
both scotopic and mesopic FCP results between the MP-1S and the
S-MAIA in AMD eyes need to consider variable susceptibility of
floor and ceiling effects. Further software updates are desirable
as FCP captures visual functional loss that is not noted with
best-corrected central visual acuity and is important for
clinical trials in AMD.},
