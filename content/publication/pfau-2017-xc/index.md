abstract: "Purpose: To determine the effective dynamic range (EDR), retest reliability,
  and number of discriminable steps (DS) for mesopic and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled
  perimetry (FCP) using the S-MAIA (Scotopic-Macular Integrity Assessment) ``micro-perimeter.''
  Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study, each of the 52 eyes of 52 subjects
  with various macular diseases (mean age 62.0 $±$ 16.9 years; range, 19.1-90.1 years)
  underwent duplicate mesopic (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm), dark-adapted cyan
  (505 nm), and dark-adapted red (627 nm) FCP using a grid of 61 stimuli covering
  18° of the central retina. The EDR, the number of DS, and the retest reliability
  for point-wise sensitivity (PWS) were analyzed. The effects of fixation stability,
  sensitivity, and age on retest reliability were examined using mixed-effects models.
  Results: The EDR was 10 to 30 dB with five DS for mesopic and 4 to 17 dB with four
  DS for dark-adapted cyan and red testing. PWS retest reliability was good among
  all three types of retinal sensitivity assessments (coefficient of repeatability
  $±$5.79, $±$4.72, and $±$4.77 dB, respectively) and did not depend on fixation stability
  or age. PWS had no effect on retest variability in dark-adapted cyan and dark-adapted
  red testing but had a minor effect in mesopic testing. Conclusions: Combined mesopic
  and dark-adapted two-color FCP allows for reliable topographic testing of cone and
  rod function in patients with various macular diseases with and without foveal fixation.
  Retest reliability is homogeneous across eccentricities and various degrees of scotoma
  depth, including zones at risk for disease progression. These reliability estimates
  can serve for the design of future clinical trials."
