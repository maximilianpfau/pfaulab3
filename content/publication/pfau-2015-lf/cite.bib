 abstract = {PURPOSE: After 48 months, unresolved macular edema secondary to
central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is present in more than
half of the patients treated with ranibizumab/bevacizumab.
Switching therapy to aflibercept, a more recent vascular
endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) inhibitor, as well as
VEGF-B and placental growth factor inhibitor, might improve the
clinical outcome in patients with CRVO who respond
insufficiently to ranibizumab/bevacizumab. METHODS: The
presented study is a retrospective analysis of CRVO patients (n
= 13) responding insufficiently to ranibizumab and/or
bevacizumab (requiring treatment every 6 weeks or more
frequently). Treatment in these patients was switched to
aflibercept, which was administered based on a 'treat and
extend' regime. The injection interval, relapse-free interval,
central retinal thickness, central retinal volume, visual
acuity, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were evaluated prior to
switching to aflibercept and at month 6 and year 1 after
switching therapy. RESULTS: From baseline to year 1 after
switching therapy to aflibercept, the mean injection interval
(primary end point) increased by 0.51 months (p = 0.023) and the
relapse-free interval by 3.02 weeks (p = 0.003). The mean
central retinal thickness decreased by 195.84 Âµm and the mean
central retinal volume (6 mm diameter) by -1.81 mm3 (p = 0.007).
Correspondingly, the mean ETDRS score increased from 66.15 at
baseline to 76.54 letters at year 1 after switching therapy to
aflibercept (+10.38 letters, p = 0.021). The IOP was not
statistically significantly affected (-1.2 mm Hg, p = 0.196).
CONCLUSION: Switching therapy from intravitreal
ranibizumab/bevacizumab to aflibercept in insufficiently
responding macular edema secondary to CRVO elongates the
injection interval and the relapse-free interval and provides an
improved anatomical as well as functional outcome.},
