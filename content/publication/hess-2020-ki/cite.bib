 abstract = {Importance: Correlates for Bruch membrane alterations are needed
for interventional trials targeting the Bruch membrane in
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). Objectives: To quantify mesopic
and scotopic light sensitivity and identify its microstructural
correlates associated with a diseased Bruch membrane in patients
with PXE. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective,
single-center, cross-sectional case-control study was conducted
at a tertiary referral center from January 31, 2018, to February
20, 2020. Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients with PXE and 40 eyes of
40 healthy individuals were included. Data analysis was
completed March 15, 2020. Exposures: Mesopic and dark-adapted
2-color fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry) and
multimodal retinal imaging including spectral-domain optical
coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and OCT angiography were
performed. Perimetry thresholds were analyzed using mixed
models, and structure-function correlation with SD-OCT data was
performed using machine learning. Main Outcomes and Measures:
Observed dark-adapted cyan sensitivity loss as measure of rod
photoreceptor dysfunction, as well as mean absolute error
between predicted and observed retinal sensitivity to assess the
accuracy of structure-function correlation. Results: Of the 22
patients with PXE included in this study, 15 were women (68%);
median age was 56.5 years (interquartile range, 50.4-61.2).
These patients exhibited mesopic (estimate, 5.13 dB; 95% CI,
2.89-7.38 dB), dark-adapted cyan (estimate, 9.08 dB; 95% CI,
6.34-11.82 dB), and dark-adapted red (estimate, 7.05 dB; 95%
CI, 4.83-9.27 dB) sensitivity losses. This sensitivity loss was
also evident in 9 eyes with nonneovascular PXE (mesopic:
estimate, 3.21 dB; 95% CI, 1.28-5.14 dB; dark-adapted cyan:
5.93 dB; 95% CI, 3.59-8.27 dB; and dark-adapted red testing:
4.84 dB; 95% CI, 2.88-6.80 dB), showing a distinct centrifugal
pattern of sensitivity loss with preserved function toward the
periphery. Retinal function could be predicted from
microstructure with high accuracy (mean absolute errors, of 4.91
dB for mesopic, 5.44 dB for dark-adapted cyan, and 4.99 dB for
dark-adapted red). The machine learning-based analysis
highlighted an association of a thinned inner retina and
putative separation of the pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor
complex with sensitivity loss. Conclusions and Relevance: In
this study, among 22 patients with PXE, those with and without
choroidal neovascularization exhibited reductions of retinal
sensitivity being most pronounced in dark-adapted cyan testing.
This finding suggests that pathologic characteristics of this
Bruch membrane disease may be dominated by rod photoreceptor
degeneration and/or dysfunction. A putative
pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor separation may further impair
rod function, while inner retinal abnormalities appear to be
correlated with overall dysfunction.},
