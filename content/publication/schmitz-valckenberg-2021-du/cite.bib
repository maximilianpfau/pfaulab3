 abstract = {Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging is an in vivo imaging
method that allows for topographic mapping of naturally or
pathologically occurring intrinsic fluorophores of the ocular
fundus. The dominant sources are fluorophores accumulating as
lipofuscin in lysosomal storage bodies in postmitotic retinal
pigment epithelium cells as well as other fluorophores that may
occur with disease in the outer retina and subretinal space.
Photopigments of the photoreceptor outer segments as well as
macular pigment and melanin at the fovea and parafovea may act
as filters of the excitation light. FAF imaging has been shown
to be useful with regard to understanding of pathophysiological
mechanisms, diagnostics, phenotype-genotype correlation,
identification of prognostic markers for disease progression,
and novel outcome parameters to assess efficacy of
interventional strategies in chorio-retinal diseases. More
recently, the spectrum of FAF imaging has been expanded with
increasing use of green in addition to blue FAF, introduction of
spectrally-resolved FAF, near-infrared FAF, quantitative FAF
imaging and fluorescence life time imaging (FLIO). This article
gives an overview of basic principles, FAF findings in various
retinal diseases and an update on recent developments.},
