abstract: Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging is an in vivo imaging method that
  allows for topographic mapping of naturally or pathologically occurring intrinsic
  fluorophores of the ocular fundus. The dominant sources are fluorophores accumulating
  as lipofuscin in lysosomal storage bodies in postmitotic retinal pigment epithelium
  cells as well as other fluorophores that may occur with disease in the outer retina
  and subretinal space. Photopigments of the photoreceptor outer segments as well
  as macular pigment and melanin at the fovea and parafovea may act as filters of
  the excitation light. FAF imaging has been shown to be useful with regard to understanding
  of pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostics, phenotype-genotype correlation, identification
  of prognostic markers for disease progression, and novel outcome parameters to assess
  efficacy of interventional strategies in chorio-retinal diseases. More recently,
  the spectrum of FAF imaging has been expanded with increasing use of green in addition
  to blue FAF, introduction of spectrally-resolved FAF, near-infrared FAF, quantitative
  FAF imaging and fluorescence life time imaging (FLIO). This article gives an overview
  of basic principles, FAF findings in various retinal diseases and an update on recent
  developments.
