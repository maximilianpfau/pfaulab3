are needed for treatment trials in geographic atrophy (GA)
secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Objective:
To quantify photoreceptor degeneration outside regions of GA in
eyes with nonexudative AMD, to evaluate its association with
future GA progression, and to characterize its spatio-temporal
progression. Design, Setting, and Participants: Monocenter
cohort study (Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy
[NCT02051998]) and analysis of data from a normative data study
at a tertiary referral center. One hundred fifty-eight eyes of
89 patients with a mean (SD) age of 77.7 (7.1) years, median
area of GA of 8.87 mm2 (IQR, 4.09-15.60), and median follow-up
of 1.1 years (IQR, 0.52-1.7 years), as well as 93 normal eyes
from 93 participants. Exposures: Longitudinal spectral-domain
optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volume scans (121 B-scans
across 30° $\times$ 25°) were segmented with a deep-learning
pipeline and standardized in a pointwise manner with
age-adjusted normal data (z scores). Outer nuclear layer (ONL),
photoreceptor inner segment (IS), and outer segment (OS)
thickness were quantified along evenly spaced contour lines
surrounding GA lesions. Linear mixed models were applied to
assess the association between photoreceptor-related imaging
features and GA progression rates and characterize the pattern
of photoreceptor degeneration over time. Main Outcomes and
Measures: Association of ONL thinning with follow-up time (after
adjusting for age, retinal topography [z score], and distance to
the GA boundary). Results: The study included 158 eyes of 89
patients (51 women and 38 men) with a mean (SD) age of 77.7
(7.1) years. The fully automated B-scan segmentation was
accurate (dice coefficient, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.85; compared
with manual markings) and revealed a marked interpatient
variability in photoreceptor degeneration. The ellipsoid zone
(EZ) loss-to-GA boundary distance and OS thickness were
prognostic for future progression rates. Outer nuclear layer and
IS thinning over time was significant even when adjusting for
age and proximity to the GA boundary (estimates of -0.16
$μ$m/y; 95% CI, -0.30 to -0.02; and -0.17 $μ$m/y; 95% CI,
-0.26 to -0.09). Conclusions and Relevance: Distinct and
progressive alterations of photoreceptor laminae (exceeding GA
spatially) were detectable and quantifiable. The degree of
photoreceptor degeneration outside of regions of retinal pigment
epithelium atrophy varied markedly between eyes and was
associated with future GA progression. Macula-wide photoreceptor
laminae thinning represents a potential candidate end point to
monitor treatment effects beyond mere GA lesion size
