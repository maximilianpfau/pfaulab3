 abstract = {Equipping an ophthalmoscope with adaptive optics (AO) offers
access to the living human retina with unprecedented spatial
resolution. With AO, cellular structures such as the nerve fiber
layer, the microvasculature of the smallest retinal capillaries,
rod and cone photoreceptors and the mosaic of the retinal
pigment epithelium are directly observable. A large number of
studies in the normal and diseased retina have already shown
that this level of detail offers new insights into disease
mechanisms and progression, and promises to identify early
disease markers. In conjunction with functional testing of
single photoreceptors that is possible with AO microstimulation,
a structure-function relationship on the cellular scale is
within reach. These technological advances offer new avenues for
clinical ophthalmology, interventional efforts, and basic
research of the function and dysfunction of vision.},
