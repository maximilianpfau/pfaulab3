abstract: Equipping an ophthalmoscope with adaptive optics (AO) offers access to the
  living human retina with unprecedented spatial resolution. With AO, cellular structures
  such as the nerve fiber layer, the microvasculature of the smallest retinal capillaries,
  rod and cone photoreceptors and the mosaic of the retinal pigment epithelium are
  directly observable. A large number of studies in the normal and diseased retina
  have already shown that this level of detail offers new insights into disease mechanisms
  and progression, and promises to identify early disease markers. In conjunction
  with functional testing of single photoreceptors that is possible with AO microstimulation,
  a structure-function relationship on the cellular scale is within reach. These technological
  advances offer new avenues for clinical ophthalmology, interventional efforts, and
  basic research of the function and dysfunction of vision.
