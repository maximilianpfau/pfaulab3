 abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the interreader agreement for incomplete
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and outer retinal atrophy
(iRORA) and complete RPE and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) and
their related features in age-related macular degeneration
(AMD). DESIGN: Interreader agreement study. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve
readers from 6 reading centers. METHODS: After formal training,
readers qualitatively assessed 60 OCT B-scans from 60 eyes with
AMD for 9 individual features associated with early atrophy and
performed 7 different annotations to quantify the spatial extent
of OCT features within regions of interest. The qualitative and
quantitative features were used to derive the presence of iRORA
and cRORA and also in an exploratory analysis to examine if
agreement could be improved using different combinations of
features to define OCT atrophy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
Interreader agreement based on Gwet's first-order agreement
coefficient (AC1) for qualitatively graded OCT features and
classification of iRORA and cRORA, and smallest real difference
(SRD) for quantitatively graded OCT features. RESULTS:
Substantial or better interreader agreement was observed for all
qualitatively graded OCT features associated with atrophy (AC1 =
0.63-0.87), except for RPE attenuation (AC1 = 0.46) and
disruption (AC1 = 0.26). The lowest SRD for the quantitatively
graded horizontal features was observed for the zone of
choroidal hypertransmission ($±$ 190.8 $μ$m). Moderate
agreement was found for a 3-category classification of no
atrophy, iRORA, and cRORA (AC1 = 0.53). Exploratory analyses
suggested a significantly higher level of agreement for a
3-category classification using (1) no atrophy; (2) presence of
inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer subsidence, or a
hyporeflective wedge-shaped band, as a less severe atrophic
grade; and (3) the latter plus an additional requirement of
choroidal hypertransmission of 250 $μ$m or more for a more
severe atrophic grade (AC1 = 0.68; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS:
Assessment of iRORA and cRORA, and most of their associated
features, can be performed relatively consistently and robustly.
A refined combination of features to define early atrophy could
further improve interreader agreement.},
