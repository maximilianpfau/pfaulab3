abstract: "Purpose: To investigate residual sensitivity within geographic atrophy
  (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration. Methods: Mesopic and dark-adapted
  (DA) cyan and red light sensitivity (Goldmann III) were investigated using fundus-controlled
  perimetry (microperimetry). Test points were placed within GA along an ``iso-hull''
  with a distance of -0.645° to the atrophy boundary. The false-positive response
  rate was determined with suprathreshold stimuli to the optic disc (Heijl-Krakau
  method) and used to compute the expected sensitivity measurements for the assumption
  of absolute scotomata. The outermost visible retinal layer on spectral-domain optical
  coherence tomography at the location of each test point was determined. Results:
  Thirty eyes of 36 patients (75.55 $±$ 7.93 years; 19 female) from the prospective
  natural history study Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy (NCT02051998), with
  a total of 1380 threshold determinations were analyzed. The measured sensitivities
  were significantly (P < 0.01) higher than the expected values for absolute scotomata
  (mean $±$ standard error of +6.92 $±$ 0.86 dB for mesopic, +2.57 $±$ 0.56 dB for
  DA cyan, and +4.93 $±$ 0.74 dB for DA red testing). For mesopic testing and DA red
  testing, the presence of a residual outer nuclear layer had a significant effect
  on this discrepancy (P < 0.001). There was no effect of fixation stability or any
  other reliability index on this discrepancy. Conclusions: Measured sensitivities
  within the inner junctional zone of GA may not be purely explained by patient-specific
  false-positive response rates or other reliability indices. The marked influence
  of the outer retinal configuration on measured sensitivity may be indicative of
  residual cone function within GA at the inner junctional zone."
