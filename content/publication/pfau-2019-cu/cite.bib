 abstract = {Purpose: To investigate residual sensitivity within geographic
atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration.
Methods: Mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red light
sensitivity (Goldmann III) were investigated using
fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry). Test points were
placed within GA along an ``iso-hull'' with a distance of
-0.645° to the atrophy boundary. The false-positive response
rate was determined with suprathreshold stimuli to the optic
disc (Heijl-Krakau method) and used to compute the expected
sensitivity measurements for the assumption of absolute
scotomata. The outermost visible retinal layer on
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography at the location of
each test point was determined. Results: Thirty eyes of 36
patients (75.55 $±$ 7.93 years; 19 female) from the
prospective natural history study Directional Spread in
Geographic Atrophy (NCT02051998), with a total of 1380 threshold
determinations were analyzed. The measured sensitivities were
significantly (P < 0.01) higher than the expected values for
absolute scotomata (mean $±$ standard error of +6.92 $±$
0.86 dB for mesopic, +2.57 $±$ 0.56 dB for DA cyan, and +4.93
$±$ 0.74 dB for DA red testing). For mesopic testing and DA
red testing, the presence of a residual outer nuclear layer had
a significant effect on this discrepancy (P < 0.001). There was
no effect of fixation stability or any other reliability index
on this discrepancy. Conclusions: Measured sensitivities within
the inner junctional zone of GA may not be purely explained by
patient-specific false-positive response rates or other
reliability indices. The marked influence of the outer retinal
configuration on measured sensitivity may be indicative of
residual cone function within GA at the inner junctional zone.},
