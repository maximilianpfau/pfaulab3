abstract: 'Purpose: To evaluate the development of central atrophy in eyes with age-related
  macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: Six-year longitudinal multimodal retinal imaging
  data (MODIAMD study) from 98 eyes of 98 subjects with non-late-stage AMD in the
  study eye at baseline were analyzed for the presence of central atrophy at each
  annual follow-up visit. Development, manifestation, and further progression of complete
  retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) by multimodal imaging
  data were compared with atrophy detection based on color fundus photography only.
  Results: Seventeen study eyes with development of central cRORA within 6 years (cumulative
  rate: 17.4%) were identified based on multimodal imaging. In 10 (60%) of these eyes,
  presence of central manifest atrophy was initially not detectable by color fundus
  photography. In six (35%) eyes, central cRORA occurred by the spread of existing
  paracentral atrophy toward the fovea. Drusen-associated atrophy development was
  noted in eight eyes. In two eyes, atrophy development was associated with refractile
  deposits, while only pigmentary changes in absence of large drusen or refractile
  deposits were detectable before atrophy occurrence in one eye. Conclusions: The
  earlier and more precise detection of central cRORA by multimodal imaging as compared
  to atrophy detection solely based on color fundus photography allows for more accurate
  detection and identification of different pathways for atrophy development. In accordance
  with previous clinical and histopathologic reports, the results confirm that different
  precursor lesions may independently proceed to central cRORA in AMD.'
