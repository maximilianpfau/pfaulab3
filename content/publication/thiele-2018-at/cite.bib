 abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the development of central atrophy in eyes
with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: Six-year
longitudinal multimodal retinal imaging data (MODIAMD study) from
98 eyes of 98 subjects with non-late-stage AMD in the study eye
at baseline were analyzed for the presence of central atrophy at
each annual follow-up visit. Development, manifestation, and
further progression of complete retinal pigment epithelium and
outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) by multimodal imaging data were
compared with atrophy detection based on color fundus photography
only. Results: Seventeen study eyes with development of central
cRORA within 6 years (cumulative rate: 17.4%) were identified
based on multimodal imaging. In 10 (60%) of these eyes, presence
of central manifest atrophy was initially not detectable by color
fundus photography. In six (35%) eyes, central cRORA occurred by
the spread of existing paracentral atrophy toward the fovea.
Drusen-associated atrophy development was noted in eight eyes. In
two eyes, atrophy development was associated with refractile
deposits, while only pigmentary changes in absence of large
drusen or refractile deposits were detectable before atrophy
occurrence in one eye. Conclusions: The earlier and more precise
detection of central cRORA by multimodal imaging as compared to
atrophy detection solely based on color fundus photography allows
for more accurate detection and identification of different
pathways for atrophy development. In accordance with previous
clinical and histopathologic reports, the results confirm that
different precursor lesions may independently proceed to central
cRORA in AMD.},
