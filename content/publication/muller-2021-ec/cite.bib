 abstract = {Spatially-resolved retinal function can be measured by
psychophysical testing like fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP or
'microperimetry'). It may serve as a performance outcome measure
in emerging interventional clinical trials for macular diseases
as requested by regulatory agencies. As FCP constitute laborious
examinations, we have evaluated a machine-learning-based
approach to predict spatially-resolved retinal function
('inferred sensitivity') based on microstructural imaging
(obtained by spectral domain optical coherence tomography) and
patient data in recessive Stargardt disease. Using nested
cross-validation, prediction accuracies of (mean absolute error,
MAE [95% CI]) 4.74 dB [4.48-4.99] were achieved. After
additional inclusion of limited FCP data, the latter reached
3.89 dB [3.67-4.10] comparable to the test-retest MAE estimate
of 3.51 dB [3.11-3.91]. Analysis of the permutation importance
revealed, that the IS&OS and RPE thickness were the most
important features for the prediction of retinal sensitivity.
'Inferred sensitivity', herein, enables to accurately estimate
differential effects of retinal microstructure on
spatially-resolved function in Stargardt disease, and might be
used as quasi-functional surrogate marker for a refined and
time-efficient investigation of possible functionally relevant
treatment effects or disease progression.},
