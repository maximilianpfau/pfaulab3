 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the association between the presence of
type 1 choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and the localized
progression of atrophy in age-related macular degeneration
(AMD). DESIGN: Analysis of patients' data collected in the
context of 2 noninterventional, prospective studies conducted at
the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn, Germany.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 98 eyes diagnosed with AMD of 59
patients (40 female, 19 male) with a mean ($±$standard
deviation) age at baseline of 76.60$±$6.65 years and median
(interquartile range) review period of 1.17 years (1.01-1.55)
were included. Eyes were subdivided into 3 categories based on
multimodal imaging and ocular history: retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) atrophy with treatment-naı̈ve quiescent CNV
(n=7), RPE atrophy with a history of exudative CNV (n=10), and
RPE atrophy without evidence of coexisting CNV (n=81). METHODS:
Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was delineated on the basis
of serial fundus-autofluorescence and infrared-reflectance
images. If CNV was detected by OCT angiography (OCTA), its
location and dimension were spatially mapped to RPE atrophy. The
localized progression of RPE atrophy in topographic relation to
the CNV lesion was then analyzed using mixed-effects logistic
regression. The spatial overlap (Dice coefficient) between
predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression was evaluated to
estimate the model accuracy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratio
(OR) for localized RPE atrophy progression in areas overlying
type 1 CNV. RESULTS: The prediction model achieved a high
overlap between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression
with a cross-validated Dice coefficient of 0.87 (95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.85-0.89) reflecting a high accuracy. The odds
for future RPE atrophy involvement were reduced by a factor of
0.21 (95% CI, 0.19-0.24) in the presence of
treatment-na\̈ve quiescent type 1 CNV and by a factor of
0.46 (95% CI, 0.41-0.51) in the presence of exudative type 1
CNV. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is markedly
reduced RPE atrophy progression in areas co-localizing with
quiescent and exudative type 1 CNV. This observation is
compatible with a potential protective effect of type 1 CNV on
the RPE and overlying neurosensory retina. These results may
have relevant clinical implications for the management of CNV
and lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent atrophy
progression.},
