 abstract = {PURPOSE: Two-colour computerised perimetry is a technique
developed for assessing cone- and rod-function at fixed
background luminances in retinal disease. However, the state of
adaptation during testing is unknown but crucial in the
interpretation of results. We therefore aimed to determine the
adaptational state of rod- and cone-mechanisms in two-colour
perimetry. METHODS: Sensitivity to 480 nm (blue) and 640 nm
(red) Goldmann size V targets was determined for 10 normal
subjects aged 16 to 46 years at 17 locations in the central 60
degrees of the visual field under scotopic conditions and then
from -1.5 log cd m-2 to 2 log cd m-2 (white background) in 0.5
log unit steps. Data were fitted with threshold versus intensity
(tvi) functions of the form logT = logT0 + log ((A + A0 )/A0 )n
. RESULTS: No clear rod-cone break was observed for 640 nm
stimuli. For 480 nm stimuli, transition from rod-detection to
cone-detection occurred at mesopic illumination levels, where
rod adaptation approached Weber behaviour. Cone detection
mechanisms did not display Weber-like adaptation until the
background luminance approached 1 log cd.m-2 . Diseases
resulting in a ``filter effect'' - including disorders of the
photoreceptors - are therefore predicted to affect sensitivity
when rod function is probed with short-wavelength targets under
scotopic conditions, but less so under mesopic conditions.
Filter effects are similarly anticipated to affect cone function
measured using long-wavelength targets under mesopic conditions
(e.g., during microperimetry), but less so under photopic
conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Asymmetries in adaptation in automated
two-colour perimetry are predicted to artefactually favour the
detection of losses in rod sensitivity under scotopic conditions
and cones under mesopic conditions.},
