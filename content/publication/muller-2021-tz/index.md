abstract: Geographic atrophy (GA) represents the non-exudative late stage of age-related
  macular degeneration and constitutes a leading cause of legal blindness in the developed
  world. It is characterized by areas of loss of outer retinal layers including photoreceptors,
  degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, and rarefication of the choriocapillaris.
  As all three layers are functionally connected, the precise temporal sequence and
  relative contribution of these layers towards the development and progression of
  GA is unclear. The advent of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) has
  allowed for three-dimensional visualization of retinal blood flow. Using OCT-A,
  recent studies have demonstrated that choriocapillaris flow alterations are particularly
  associated with the development of GA, exceed atrophy boundaries spatially, and
  are a prognostic factor for future GA progression. Furthermore, OCT-A may be helpful
  to differentiate GA from mimicking diseases. Evidence for a potential protective
  effect of specific forms of choroidal neovascularization in the context of GA has
  been reported. This article aims to give a comprehensive review of the current literature
  concerning the application of OCT-A in GA, and summarizes the opportunities and
  limitations with regard to pathophysiologic considerations, differential diagnosis,
  study design, and patient assessment.
