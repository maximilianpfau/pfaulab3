 abstract = {Geographic atrophy (GA) represents the non-exudative late stage
of age-related macular degeneration and constitutes a leading
cause of legal blindness in the developed world. It is
characterized by areas of loss of outer retinal layers including
photoreceptors, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium,
and rarefication of the choriocapillaris. As all three layers
are functionally connected, the precise temporal sequence and
relative contribution of these layers towards the development
and progression of GA is unclear. The advent of optical
coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) has allowed for
three-dimensional visualization of retinal blood flow. Using
OCT-A, recent studies have demonstrated that choriocapillaris
flow alterations are particularly associated with the
development of GA, exceed atrophy boundaries spatially, and are
a prognostic factor for future GA progression. Furthermore,
OCT-A may be helpful to differentiate GA from mimicking
diseases. Evidence for a potential protective effect of specific
forms of choroidal neovascularization in the context of GA has
been reported. This article aims to give a comprehensive review
of the current literature concerning the application of OCT-A in
GA, and summarizes the opportunities and limitations with regard
to pathophysiologic considerations, differential diagnosis,
study design, and patient assessment.},
