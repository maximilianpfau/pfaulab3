 abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify anatomic determinants of reading
performance in eyes with foveal-sparing geographic atrophy (GA).
DESIGN: Prospectively recruited, cross-sectional study, SIGHT
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT02332343). PARTICIPANTS:
Patients with foveal-sparing GA secondary to age-related macular
degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Monocular best-corrected visual
acuity and reading acuity together with reading speed were
assessed using Radner charts. Fundus autofluorescence,
near-infrared reflectance, and spectral-domain OCT images were
acquired using a Spectralis device. The minimal required reading
rectangle (M3R), 19 letters $\times$ 2.4 lines in the smallest
readable print size of an individual eye, was computed. The
status of the M3R was determined as either free of atrophy or
involved in the atrophic process, and the impact on reading was
assessed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radner reading score (logRAD)
and reading speed (words per minute [wpm]). RESULTS: A total of
45 eyes of 31 patients (30 women; mean age, 76.14 years [range,
64.17-89.22 years]) were included. Median best-corrected visual
acuity was 0.20 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution
(logMAR; Snellen equivalent, 20/32). Reading score was 0.52
logRAD (IQR, 0.30-1.4 logRAD) and maximum reading speed was
141.19 wpm (IQR, 105.52-164.62 wpm). In 27 eyes, the M3R was
involved in the atrophic process. This was associated with a
significant worsening in Radner score (1.21 logRAD [IQR,
0.46-1.40 logRAD] vs. 0.31 logRAD [IQR, 0.20-0.51 logRAD]; P <
0.001) and reading speed (110.84 wpm [IQR, 90.0-131.92 wpm] vs.
162.34 wpm [IQR, 137.51-176.66 wpm]; P = 0.002). Eyes in which
the M3R was nonatrophic additionally showed an increase in
reading speed with decreasing print size (peak increase, +73.08
wpm [IQR, 27.43-86.64 wpm] compared with the largest test
sentence). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that a defined area
on the retina that can be assessed by retinal imaging is
required for unhindered reading in patients with foveal-sparing
GA. The findings highlight that smaller test sentences can be
read faster by patients with this AMD subphenotype. Our results
allow prediction of reading impairment based on imaging
parameters in clinical routine and may support establishing
anatomic surrogate end points in clinical trials. Furthermore,
the findings could be used to facilitate the adjustment of
magnifying reading aids.},
