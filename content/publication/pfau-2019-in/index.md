abstract: 'PURPOSE: To systematically compare the prognostic value of multiple shape-descriptive
  factors in the natural course of the disease. METHODS: A total of 296 eyes of 201
  patients (female patients 130; mean age: 72.2 $Â±$ 13.08 years) with a median follow-up
  of 2.38 years from 2 prospective, noninterventional natural history studies (Fundus-Autofluorescence-in-Age-related-Macular-Degeneration
  [clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00393692], Directional-Spread-in-Geographic-Atrophy
  [NCT02051998]) were included in the analysis. Serial fundus autofluorescence images
  were annotated using semiautomated image analysis software to determine the lesion
  area, circularity, perimeter, and caliper diameters. These variables and the fundus
  autofluorescence phenotype were evaluated for prediction of the future square root
  progression rates using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: For the combined model,
  leave-one-out cross validation on patient level (Scenario 1: previously unknown
  patient) resulted in a goodness-to-fit (R value) of 0.244 and leave-one-out cross
  validation on visit level (Scenario 2: previous observation of the patient) in a
  R value of 0.391. This indicated that shape-descriptive factors could explain 24.4%
  of the variance in geographic atrophy progression in previously unknown patients
  and 39.1% in patients with previous observation. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm
  the relevance of shape-descriptive factors and previous progression as prognostic
  variables for geographic atrophy progression. However, a substantial part of the
  remaining variation in geographic atrophy progression seems to depend on other variables,
  some of which are visible in optical coherence tomography.'
