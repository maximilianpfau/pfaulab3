 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate differences in quantitative
autofluorescence (qAF) imaging measurements between eyes with
and without large drusen, and whether qAF measurements change
over time in the eyes with large drusen. METHODS: Eighty-five
eyes from participants with bilateral large drusen and 51 eyes
from healthy participants underwent qAF imaging at least once,
and the age-related macular degeneration participants were
reviewed 6-monthly. Normalized grey values at 9° to 11°
eccentricity from the fovea were averaged to provide a summary
measure of qAF values (termed qAF8). RESULTS: In a multivariable
model, qAF8 measurements were not significantly different
between age-related macular degeneration eyes with large drusen
and healthy eyes (P = 0.130), and qAF8 measurements showed a
decline over time in the age-related macular degeneration eyes
(P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: These findings add to the body of
evidence that qAF levels are not increased in eyes with large
drusen compared with healthy eyes, and qAF levels show a
significant decline over time in the age-related macular
degeneration eyes. These findings highlight how the relationship
between qAF levels and retinal pigment epithelium health does
not seem to be straightforward. Further investigation is
required to better understand this relationship, especially if
qAF levels are to be used as an outcome measure in intervention
trials.},
