abstract: 'PURPOSE: To investigate differences in quantitative autofluorescence (qAF)
  imaging measurements between eyes with and without large drusen, and whether qAF
  measurements change over time in the eyes with large drusen. METHODS: Eighty-five
  eyes from participants with bilateral large drusen and 51 eyes from healthy participants
  underwent qAF imaging at least once, and the age-related macular degeneration participants
  were reviewed 6-monthly. Normalized grey values at 9° to 11° eccentricity from the
  fovea were averaged to provide a summary measure of qAF values (termed qAF8). RESULTS:
  In a multivariable model, qAF8 measurements were not significantly different between
  age-related macular degeneration eyes with large drusen and healthy eyes (P = 0.130),
  and qAF8 measurements showed a decline over time in the age-related macular degeneration
  eyes (P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: These findings add to the body of evidence that qAF
  levels are not increased in eyes with large drusen compared with healthy eyes, and
  qAF levels show a significant decline over time in the age-related macular degeneration
  eyes. These findings highlight how the relationship between qAF levels and retinal
  pigment epithelium health does not seem to be straightforward. Further investigation
  is required to better understand this relationship, especially if qAF levels are
  to be used as an outcome measure in intervention trials.'
