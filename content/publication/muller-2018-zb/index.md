abstract: 'PURPOSE: To investigate the interreader and intermodality agreement for
  grading of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy lesion size in ABCA4-related
  retinopathy using green (GAF) and blue fundus autofluorescence (BAF) imaging. METHODS:
  In this cross-sectional case series, 97 eyes of 49 patients with RPE atrophy secondary
  to ABCA4-related retinopathy underwent GAF- (518 nm excitation light) and BAF- (488
  nm excitation light) imaging using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Spectralis
  HRA, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Lesions with definitely decreased
  autofluorescence (DDAF) and questionably decreased autofluorescence (QDAF) in GAF
  and BAF imaging were analyzed separately by five independent readers using semiautomated
  software (RegionFinder, Heidelberg Engineering). Intermodality and interreader agreements
  were assessed for the square-root lesion size, lesion perimeter, and circularity.
  RESULTS: GAF- and BAF-based measurements of DDAF and QDAF showed high intermodality
  and interreader agreement concerning square-root lesion size, as well as shape descriptive
  parameters (perimeter and circularity). Interreader agreement of square-root lesion
  size was slightly, hence not significantly higher for GAF-based grading ([95% coefficients
  of repeatability, intraclass correlation coefficient] DDAF: 0.215 mm, 0.997; QDAF:
  0.712 mm, 0.981) compared to BAF-based grading (DDAF: 0.232 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.764
  mm, 0.978). However, DDAF-measurements revealed distinctly more reproducible results
  than QDAF-measurements. Foveal sparing did not interfere with intermodality agreement.
  CONCLUSIONS: Both GAF- and BAF-based quantification of RPE atrophy showed very reliable
  results with possible superiority of GAF in the context of less energetic excitation
  light. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The high interreader agreement qualifies the use
  of DDAF progression in GAF and BAF imaging as potential morphologic outcome measure
  for interventional clinical trials and disease monitoring.'
