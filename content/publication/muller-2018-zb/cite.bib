 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the interreader and intermodality
agreement for grading of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
atrophy lesion size in ABCA4-related retinopathy using green
(GAF) and blue fundus autofluorescence (BAF) imaging. METHODS:
In this cross-sectional case series, 97 eyes of 49 patients with
RPE atrophy secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy underwent
GAF- (518 nm excitation light) and BAF- (488 nm excitation
light) imaging using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy
(Spectralis HRA, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany).
Lesions with definitely decreased autofluorescence (DDAF) and
questionably decreased autofluorescence (QDAF) in GAF and BAF
imaging were analyzed separately by five independent readers
using semiautomated software (RegionFinder, Heidelberg
Engineering). Intermodality and interreader agreements were
assessed for the square-root lesion size, lesion perimeter, and
circularity. RESULTS: GAF- and BAF-based measurements of DDAF
and QDAF showed high intermodality and interreader agreement
concerning square-root lesion size, as well as shape descriptive
parameters (perimeter and circularity). Interreader agreement of
square-root lesion size was slightly, hence not significantly
higher for GAF-based grading ([95% coefficients of
repeatability, intraclass correlation coefficient] DDAF: 0.215
mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.712 mm, 0.981) compared to BAF-based grading
(DDAF: 0.232 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.764 mm, 0.978). However,
DDAF-measurements revealed distinctly more reproducible results
than QDAF-measurements. Foveal sparing did not interfere with
intermodality agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Both GAF- and BAF-based
quantification of RPE atrophy showed very reliable results with
possible superiority of GAF in the context of less energetic
excitation light. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The high interreader
agreement qualifies the use of DDAF progression in GAF and BAF
imaging as potential morphologic outcome measure for
interventional clinical trials and disease monitoring.},
