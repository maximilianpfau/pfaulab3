  abstract  = "PURPOSE: To analyze foveal avascular zone (FAZ) dimensions and
               symmetry in patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) compared to
               healthy controls using optical coherence tomography angiography
               (OCT angiography). METHODS: OCT angiography was performed via an
               Avanti\textregistered{} RTVue 100 XR OCT system (Optovue, Inc.,
               Fremont, CA, USA) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and
               healthy adults. A frame centered on the fovea was used for FAZ
               measurements. The borders of the superficial vascular layer were
               defined as 3 $\mu$m below the internal limiting membrane (ILM)
               and 15 $\mu$m below the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and for the
               deep vascular layer as15 $\mu$m and 70 $\mu$m below the IPL,
               respectively. Angles of maximum FAZ diameter were measured in
               all eyes by two graders. RESULTS: In healthy eyes (N = 25), the
               FAZ surrounding vascular arcades were intact, showing a vertical
               or horizontal oval symmetrical formation with a maximum diameter
               usually on the horizontal or vertical axis. Diabetic eyes (N =
               29) presented with disintegrity of the vascular arcades,
               resulting in an enlarged FAZ. In the superficial layer, the mean
               horizontal FAZ diameter was significantly larger in the DR group
               (753 $\mu$m $\pm$272 $\mu$m) than in the control group (573
               $\mu$m $\pm$177 $\mu$m, p = 0.029). The difference was even more
               pronounced in the deep layer, with a mean value of 659 $\mu$m
               $\pm$194 $\mu$m in the control group and 1009 $\mu$m $\pm$342
               $\mu$m in the DR group (p = 0.001). Furthermore, in the
               superficial layer, the angle of the maximum FAZ diameter was 0°
               ($\pm$15°) or 90° ($\pm$15°) in 72.0 \% of healthy eyes. In eyes
               with DR, the angle was 0° ($\pm$15°) or 90° ($\pm$15°) in only
               6.9 \% of cases, due to the irregular configuration of the FAZ.
               CONCLUSIONS: OCT angiography is capable of imaging retinal
               vasculature without dye injection. Our data suggest that it can
               detect disintegrity of the vascular arcades surrounding the FAZ,
               thus differentiating DM from healthy eyes. Vascular
               abnormalities were more pronounced in the deep vascular layer.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: After 48 months, unresolved macular edema secondary to
               central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is present in more than
               half of the patients treated with ranibizumab/bevacizumab.
               Switching therapy to aflibercept, a more recent vascular
               endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) inhibitor, as well as
               VEGF-B and placental growth factor inhibitor, might improve the
               clinical outcome in patients with CRVO who respond
               insufficiently to ranibizumab/bevacizumab. METHODS: The
               presented study is a retrospective analysis of CRVO patients (n
               = 13) responding insufficiently to ranibizumab and/or
               bevacizumab (requiring treatment every 6 weeks or more
               frequently). Treatment in these patients was switched to
               aflibercept, which was administered based on a 'treat and
               extend' regime. The injection interval, relapse-free interval,
               central retinal thickness, central retinal volume, visual
               acuity, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were evaluated prior to
               switching to aflibercept and at month 6 and year 1 after
               switching therapy. RESULTS: From baseline to year 1 after
               switching therapy to aflibercept, the mean injection interval
               (primary end point) increased by 0.51 months (p = 0.023) and the
               relapse-free interval by 3.02 weeks (p = 0.003). The mean
               central retinal thickness decreased by 195.84 µm and the mean
               central retinal volume (6 mm diameter) by -1.81 mm3 (p = 0.007).
               Correspondingly, the mean ETDRS score increased from 66.15 at
               baseline to 76.54 letters at year 1 after switching therapy to
               aflibercept (+10.38 letters, p = 0.021). The IOP was not
               statistically significantly affected (-1.2 mm Hg, p = 0.196).
               CONCLUSION: Switching therapy from intravitreal
               ranibizumab/bevacizumab to aflibercept in insufficiently
               responding macular edema secondary to CRVO elongates the
               injection interval and the relapse-free interval and provides an

               optical coherence tomography system (iOCT). PATIENTS AND
               METHODS: The Rescan 700 iOCT (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), a
               spectral-domain OCT system integrated into a surgical
               microscope, was used in 40 consecutive cases. A standardized
               review was used to assess whether iOCT imaging resulted in
               additional information and/or altered decision-making. RESULTS:
               The iOCT system was usable in conjunction with common
               chromovitrectomy dyes and tamponades. The surgeons reported that
               iOCT imaging provided additional information in 74.1\% of the
               posterior and combined surgical cases, which resulted in altered
               decision-making in 41.9\% of the cases. The iOCT imaging time,
               on average, amounted to 167 seconds. In anterior procedures, the
               surgeons reported gaining additional information in 22.2\% of
               all cases, but no cases of altered decision-making were
               reported. Hereby, the iOCT imaging time amounted to 117 seconds,
               on average. CONCLUSION: The demonstrated results suggest iOCT

              switching therapy from ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab to
              aflibercept in neovascular age-related macular degeneration in
              patients who had previously given an insufficient response to
              therapy with ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab. PATIENTS AND
              METHODS: 96 eyes with neovascular age-related macular
              degeneration (AMD) were included, which had been pretreated with
              ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab (T\&E), but had responded
              insufficiently. An injection interval of less than six weeks or
              permanently persisting intra- and/or subretinal fluid or
              persistent pigment epithelial detachments (PED) were defined as
              an insufficient response. The patients were followed for 12
              months after switching therapy to aflibercept. The change in
              central retinal thickness (CRT) was defined as the primary
              endpoint. Other endpoints were the axial height of PEDs and the
              injection interval. RESULTS: The primary endpoint, the average
              CRT, was significantly decreased twelve months after switching
              therapy to aflibercept (Wilcoxon Nemenyi-McDonald-Thompson
              post-hoc analysis - 31.36 µm; SD $\pm$ 70.64 µm; p < 0.001).
              Another morphological endpoint, the average axial height of PEDs,
              also decreased significantly (- 34.10 µm; SD $\pm$ 91.90 µm, p <
              0.001) from 207.82 µm (SD $\pm$ 148.12 µm) at baseline to 173.72
              µm (SD $\pm$ 132.30 µm) at month 12. Moreover, the average
              injection interval increased significantly (p < 0.001; Friedman
              test) from 1.30 months (SD $\pm$ 0.19 months) before switching
              therapy to 1.67 months (SD $\pm$ 0.19 months) at month 12 after
              switching therapy to aflibercept. However, the best corrected
              visual acuity (BCVA) as a functional endpoint did not
              significantly improve (+ 0.36 ETDRS letters = 0.0972 p; SD $\pm$
              16.94 ETDRS letters). CONCLUSION: In patients with neovascular
              AMD, who had initially exhibited an inadequate response to
              ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab, switching therapy to aflibercept
              improves clinical outcome measures. Besides morphological
              improvements, such as the decrease of the CRT and the axial
              height of PEDs, the average injection interval was prolonged.

              diffuse-trickling appearance on fundus autofluorescence imaging.
              METHODS: Patients from the Fundus Autofluorescence in Age-Related
              Macular Degeneration Study were phenotyped for diffuse-trickling
              GA (dt-GA; n = 44). DNA was analyzed for 10 known AMD-associated
              genetic variants. A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated and
              compared with patients with nondiffuse-trickling GA (ndt-GA; n =
              311) and individuals from the 1000 genomes project (1000G; n =
              267). Given the phenotypic overlap between diffuse-trickling and
              late-onset retinal degeneration (LORD), all C1QTNF5 exons and
              their exon/intron boundaries were sequenced. RESULTS: A
              statistically significant difference in allele frequencies
              between dt-GA and ndt-GA were found for CFH:rs1061170 and
              CFH:rs800292 (Pcorrected = 0.03). The ARMS2 variant rs10490924
              was significantly more frequent in dt-GA than in 1000G
              individuals (Pcorrected < 0.01). The GRS of dt-GA patients was
              in-between the score of the 1000G individuals and that of
              patients with ndt-GA, significantly differing from both
              (Pcorrected <0.01). Sequencing of C1QTNF5 revealed 28 unique
              variants although none showed a statistically significant
              association with dt-GA when compared with 1000G individuals.
              CONCLUSIONS: The dt-GA phenotype shows a remarkably different
              genetic risk profile from other GA phenotypes secondary to AMD.
              Disease-associated C1QTNF5 mutations were not identified.
              Together, these results suggest that the dt-GA phenotype is
              associated with a genetic background substantially different from
              other GA phenotypes and underlines the necessity to refine the
              clinical phenotyping, specifically when aiming for individualized

              (OCT-A) in normal individuals and patients with diabetic
              retinopathy (DR). METHODS: Images (a 3 $\times$ 3 mm cube
              centered on the fovea) were acquired in 40 eyes of 22 normal
              individuals and 28 eyes of 18 patients with varying levels of DR
              using a swept-source OCT-A device (central wavelength 1050 nm;
              A-scan-rate of 100,000 scans per second). En face images of the
              retinal vasculature were generated from the superficial and deep
              retinal layers (SRL/DRL). Quantitative analysis of the vessel
              density (VD) and FAZ area was performed. Vessel density was
              assessed as the ratio of the retinal area occupied by vessels.
              RESULTS: Among the DR subjects (mean age, 72 years; 61\% male),
              35.7\% of the eyes had mild, 35.7\% moderate, and 7.1\% severe
              nonproliferative DR (NPDR), and 21.4\% and proliferative DR
              (PDR). The mean FAZ area in patients with DR and in normal
              individuals was 0.518 and 0.339 mm2, respectively, for the SRL (P

              after uncomplicated vitrectomy for epiretinal gliosis or
              phacoemulsification (group 1: 12 eyes) or secondary to
              noninfectious endogenous uveitis (group 2: 36 eyes). Central
              retinal thickness (CRT), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA,
              logMAR), and intraocular pressure (IOP) throughout follow-up were
              gleaned from the medical records. RESULTS: In group 1, CRT
              decreased, compared with baseline, from 519 $\pm$ 43 to 297 $\pm$
              23 and 356 $\pm$ 49 $\mu$m by the 1- and 3-month visit (P = 0.02)
              and to 429 $\pm$ 57 $\mu$m before reimplantation. In group 2, CRT
              decreased from 460 $\pm$ 31 to 300 $\pm$ 21 and 312 $\pm$ 26
              $\mu$m by the 1- and 3-month follow-up, respectively (P = 0.001),
              and to 373 $\pm$ 32 $\mu$m before reimplantation. Complete
              resolution of CME was achieved in 67\% and 94\% (groups 1 and 2,
              respectively) by 1 month and in 42\% and 80\% by 3 months after
              injection. In group 1, BCVA improved from 0.46 $\pm$ 0.08 to 0.27
              $\pm$ 0.09 and 0.20 $\pm$ 0.06 (P = 0.01) by the 1- and 3-month
              follow-up, respectively, and to 0.32 $\pm$ 0.08 before
              reimplantation. In group 2, BCVA improved from 0.47 $\pm$ 0.06 to
              0.34 $\pm$ 0.09, 0.26 $\pm$ 0.07, and 0.29 $\pm$ 0.08 (P < 0.05)
              at 1 and 3 months of follow-up and before reimplantation,
              respectively. A significant IOP increase was not observed in
              either group. Mean time to reimplantation of Ozurdex was 6.4
              $\pm$ 5.7 and 6.6 $\pm$ 3.4 months for postoperative and uveitic
              CME, respectively. CONCLUSION: Ozurdex seems to achieve a

              Treatment-na{\"\i}ve eyes that were diagnosed with exudative AMD
              were prospectively examined by OCT angiography (OCT-A). The
              extent of the neovascular network was measured by three
              independent readers. Interclass-correlation coefficient and area
              overlap coefficients (OC) were calculated to assess locally
              precise agreement between measurements. As a reference for
              interreader agreement, the extent of the neovascular network was
              further measured on fluorescein angiography (FA) images. Results:
              A total of 31 eyes (27 patients, mean age 82.5 years, 15 female)
              were included in the study. Neovascularization subtype was
              classified as type I in 5, type II in 11, type III in 9, and
              mixed in 6 eyes, respectively. Interreader agreement for
              measurements of the neovascular network was 0.884 for OCT-A and
              0.636 for FA. Overlap coefficient was 0.705 (interquartile [IQR]:
              0.450-0.76) for OCT-A and 0.704 (IQR: 0.673-0.750) for FA,
              respectively. Area agreement was weaker in type III and mixed
              lesions. Conclusions: Optical coherence tomography
              angiography-based measurements of the new vessel complex in
              neovascular AMD are feasible with interreader agreement
              comparable with the values obtained for FA. The results
              underscore the potential of OCT-A as a noninvasive diagnostic
              tool in neovascular AMD. Yet, further studies will be required to
              reveal the origin of poor agreement observed in single eyes and
              to advance OCT-A toward dependable use (e.g., in a reading center

               (macular integrity assessment) device. METHODS: Forty-seven
               normal eyes of 30 subjects (aged 33.8 years) underwent duplicate
               mesopic (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm), scotopic cyan (505
               nm), and scotopic red (627 nm) FCP, using a grid of 49 stimuli

               pointwise sensitivity (PWS), stability of fixation, reaction

               RESULTS: PWS test-retest reliability was good among all 3 types
               of retinal sensitivity assessments (coefficient of repeatability
               of 4.75 dB for mesopic, 5.26 dB for scotopic cyan, and 4.06 dB

              compared with the area obtained by en face segmentation. RESULTS:
              The mean $\pm$ SD for the HE area was 1.78 $\pm$ 1.37 mm with

              Best corrected visual acuity (Early Treatment Diabetic

              near-infrared reflectance images of patients participating in the

              The sizes of GA and spared fovea, and the minimal linear
              dimension of intact retinal pigment epithelium (``bridge'')
              between the residual foveal island and the surrounding retina
              were quantified and associations with BCVA were assessed by local
              regression curves and mixed effects models. Results: A total of
              65 eyes (51 patients, aged 75.68 $\pm$ 8.41 years) were included.
              Median time between baseline and last visit with detectable
              foveal sparing was 18 (quartiles: 12, 33) months. Median BCVA was
              0.30 (0.20, 0.52) logMAR at baseline and 0.4 (0.3, 0.7) logMAR at
              follow-up. Local regression curves suggested no linear
              association of BCVA with GA size, sparing size or bridge size.
              Most contrasting values for BCVA were observed for >1.5 mm2
              foveal-sparing size and for 400 $\mu$m bridge size. Employing
              these values as cutoff levels, mixed effects modeling revealed
              that both anatomic parameters, but not time, significantly
              impacted BCVA. Conclusions: During the review period eyes with
              foveal-sparing GA were likely to maintain the baseline BCVA.
              There was no linear correlation of BCVA with foveal-sparing size.
              Yet, BCVA was worse if the spared foveal area was <1.5 mm2 or if
              the bridge was smaller than 400 $\mu$m in width. These findings

              to assess the effect of image modality on the measured
              square-root lesion area. The coefficient of repeatability (CR)
              and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were assessed for
              the square-root lesion area, lesion perimeter, and circularity.
              Results: GAF-based measurements were on average 0.062 mm (95\%
              confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.08 mm) larger than BAF+NIR-based
              measurements and 0.077 mm (95\% CI 0.06 - 0.10 mm) larger than
              BAF-based measurements. Interreader agreement was highest for
              GAF-based analysis ([CR, ICC] 0.196 mm, 0.995) followed by
              BAF+NIR (0.232 mm, 0.992) and BAF alone (0.263 mm, 0.991). The
              same was noted for the lesion perimeter and circularity. Post hoc
              review revealed that interreader differences were associated with
              media opacification interfering with lesion boundary demarcation
              to a larger extent in BAF than in GAF. Conclusions: cSLO-based
              GAF and combined BAF+NIR imaging with semiautomated lesion
              delineation allow for an accurate and reproducible quantification
              of GA. The slightly better interreader agreement using cSLO GAF
              suggests that its use may be preferable in clinical trials

              Spread in Geographic Atrophy study (NCT02051998) were screened

              epithelium (RPE)-basal lamina complex, as well as the integrity
              of the external limiting membrane (ELM) and the ellipsoid zone

              increased FAF spots and 54 control areas were included. Analysis
              of the corresponding OCT images revealed an increase in RPE-basal

              using the S-MAIA (Scotopic-Macular Integrity Assessment)
              ``micro-perimeter.'' Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional
              study, each of the 52 eyes of 52 subjects with various macular
              diseases (mean age 62.0 $\pm$ 16.9 years; range, 19.1-90.1 years)
              underwent duplicate mesopic (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm),
              dark-adapted cyan (505 nm), and dark-adapted red (627 nm) FCP
              using a grid of 61 stimuli covering 18° of the central retina.
              The EDR, the number of DS, and the retest reliability for
              point-wise sensitivity (PWS) were analyzed. The effects of
              fixation stability, sensitivity, and age on retest reliability

              to 30 dB with five DS for mesopic and 4 to 17 dB with four DS for
              dark-adapted cyan and red testing. PWS retest reliability was
              good among all three types of retinal sensitivity assessments

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare
              the MP-1S (Nidek Technologies, Padova, Italy) and the S-MAIA
              (CenterVue, Padova, Italy) for mesopic and scotopic
              fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in age-related macular
              degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Eleven eyes from 11 patients
              underwent mesopic and, after 30 minutes of dark adaptation,
              scotopic (MP-1S: Goldmann V, 200 ms, background luminance 0.0032
              cd/m2; S-MAIA: Goldman III, 200 ms, background luminance <0.0001
              cd/m2) FCP. For the S-MAIA device, cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm)
              scotopic FCP were performed. For both devices, a grid of 56
              stimulus points covering 16° of the central macula was used.
              Examination time, fixation stability, and threshold values were
              analyzed. RESULTS: The upper end of the dynamic range ($\leq$4 dB
              of lowest threshold) was frequently reached by the MP-1S for
              mesopic testing (median 34 of 56 stimuli), while threshold values
              within the lower 4 dB of the dynamic range were occasionally
              found with the S-MAIA for scotopic testing (median 3 for cyan,
              median 2 for red). After correction of the stimulus intensity for
              the S-MAIA results, the median difference for all stimuli between
              both devices for mesopic testing was -2.0 dB (interquartile range
              [-4;0], range -14 to 6). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that
              robust testing of mesopic and scotopic function is feasible with
              both devices in patients with AMD, although both devices are
              susceptible to floor and ceiling effects. TRANSLATIONAL
              RELEVANCE: The interpretation and particularly the comparison of
              both scotopic and mesopic FCP results between the MP-1S and the
              S-MAIA in AMD eyes need to consider variable susceptibility of
              floor and ceiling effects. Further software updates are desirable
              as FCP captures visual functional loss that is not noted with
              best-corrected central visual acuity and is important for
              clinical trials in AMD.",

              (OCTA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, noncomparative
              case series, 3 mm $\times$ 3 mm OCTA images of 36 eyes of 22
              healthy individuals were obtained using a swept-source
              instrument. VD and GV levels were calculated on CC en face slabs
              in the central 1-mm (subfoveal field) and surrounding 2.5-mm
              parafoveal ring. VD was calculated as a ratio of vessel area over
              nonvessel area following image binarization. GV was computed as
              the mean, un-normalized greyscale intensity value for all pixels
              in the region of interest. For each eye, the procedure was
              repeated 1 minute to 2 minutes later and intersession
              repeatability was analyzed. The choroidal thickness (CT) was
              automatically measured in the subfoveal and parafoveal regions
              and compared to VD and GV values. RESULTS: The VD ratio and GV
              was lower in the subfoveal field than in the parafoveal four
              sectors. The intersession intraclass correlation coefficients

              perimetry (FCP) in macular diseases. METHODS: Seventy-seven eyes
              (30 eyes with macular diseases and 47 normal eyes) underwent
              duplicate mesopic and dark-adapted two-colour FCP (Scotopic
              Macular Integrity Assessment, CenterVue). Non-weighted (mean
              defect, loss variance), variability-weighted (mean deviation,
              pattern standard deviation (PSD)) and graphical (cumulative
              defect (Bebie) curves) indices were computed. Reproducibility
              (coefficient of repeatability, CoR) of these indices was
              assessed. Cluster analysis was carried out to identify patterns
              of visual field deficits. RESULTS: The intrasession
              reproducibility was lower for the mean defect as compared with
              the mean deviation (CoR (dB) 2.67 vs 2.57 for mesopic, 1.71 vs
              1.45 for dark-adapted cyan, 1.94 vs 1.87 for dark-adapted red

              with the PSD (CoR (dB) 1.48 vs 1.34, 0.77 vs 0.65, 1.23 vs 1.03).
              Hierarchical cluster analysis of the indices disclosed six
              patterns of visual field deficits (approximately unbiased P
              value>0.95) with varying degrees of global versus focal defect
              and rod versus cone dysfunction. These were also reflected by the
              cumulative defect curves. CONCLUSION: FCP with mesopic and
              dark-adapted two-colour testing allows for reproducible
              assessment of different types of retinal sensitivity, whereby
              mean deviation and PSD exhibited the better retest reliability of

              be identified using this setup, reflecting variable degrees of
              rod and cone dysfunction in different macular diseases.

               volume at baseline was 0.213 $\pm$ 0.100 mm3 (pattern A) and
               0.219 $\pm$ 0.103 mm3 (pattern B) (p = 0.937). Linear
               mixed-effect models showed no significant difference for the

              longitudinal multimodal retinal imaging data (MODIAMD study) from
              98 eyes of 98 subjects with non-late-stage AMD in the study eye
              at baseline were analyzed for the presence of central atrophy at
              each annual follow-up visit. Development, manifestation, and
              further progression of complete retinal pigment epithelium and
              outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) by multimodal imaging data were
              compared with atrophy detection based on color fundus photography
              only. Results: Seventeen study eyes with development of central
              cRORA within 6 years (cumulative rate: 17.4\%) were identified
              based on multimodal imaging. In 10 (60\%) of these eyes, presence
              of central manifest atrophy was initially not detectable by color
              fundus photography. In six (35\%) eyes, central cRORA occurred by
              the spread of existing paracentral atrophy toward the fovea.
              Drusen-associated atrophy development was noted in eight eyes. In
              two eyes, atrophy development was associated with refractile
              deposits, while only pigmentary changes in absence of large
              drusen or refractile deposits were detectable before atrophy
              occurrence in one eye. Conclusions: The earlier and more precise
              detection of central cRORA by multimodal imaging as compared to
              atrophy detection solely based on color fundus photography allows
              for more accurate detection and identification of different
              pathways for atrophy development. In accordance with previous
              clinical and histopathologic reports, the results confirm that

              Methods: Patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to AMD
              were recruited in the context of the Longitudinal Fundus
              Autofluorescence in Age-related Macular Degeneration and
              Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy studies (NCT00393692,
              NCT02051998). Horizontal and vertical SD-OCT scans were acquired
              at sequential visits using a device allowing for anatomically
              accurate registration of follow-up to baseline scans. For
              quantification of local atrophy progression, the lateral spread
              of GA (LSGA) was measured. Further, border types were
              independently graded. Comparison of LSGA between the different
              border types was performed using linear mixed-effects models.
              Results: Seventy-two eyes of 49 patients (27 female) aged 74.0
              years (Inter quartile range [IQR], 68.1-79.0) were included into
              this analysis. A total of 258 border sections were analyzed
              longitudinally over a median period of 1.2 years (IQR, 0.9-1.6).
              At baseline, 17.1\% borders were classified as 'regular', 47.7\%
              as 'irregular', and 35.3\% as 'splitting'. Sixty-two percent of
              the eyes exhibited more than one border type. LSGA was slowest in
              'regular' borders (62.85 $\pm$ 25.29 $\mu$m/y), followed by
              'irregular' borders (91.15 $\pm$ 15.05 $\mu$m/y) and fastest in
              'splitting' borders (183.15 $\pm$ 18.17 $\mu$m/y). Differences

              morphology and retinal sensitivity by mesopic and scotopic
              fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in eyes with intermediate AMD.
              Methods: Thirty-five eyes from 32 patients (mean age 70.9 years)
              and 29 age-matched controls prospectively underwent
              spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging.
              Mesopic (Goldman III, 200 ms, 4-2 strategy) and scotopic (Goldman
              V, 200 ms, 4-2 strategy) FCP with a 56-stimulus point grid was
              performed in AMD patients with the MP-1S. Thickness values of
              different retinal layers were measured at each stimulus point and
              compared, topographically corresponding to values in controls of
              similar age for pointwise structural-functional analysis.
              Results: The overall mean sensitivity in patients was 16.9 $\pm$
              3.0 dB for mesopic and 14.0 $\pm$ 3.7 dB for scotopic testing.
              Within the central 4° of the macula, reduced mesopic and scotopic
              sensitivity values were found (P < 0.0001). These findings
              correlated to central increasing retinal pigment
              epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC) thickness and central
              decreasing outer nuclear layer (ONL) and photoreceptor
              (PR)-segments thickness (P < 0.0001, respectively).
              Structure-function correlations revealed that a reduction of
              mesopic and scotopic sensitivity was associated with increasing
              thickness of the total retina and the RPEDC and a decrease of the
              ONL and the PR-segments (P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions:
              Accumulation of sub-RPE material in patients with intermediate
              AMD is spatially associated to quantifiable structural
              alterations in various retinal layers and to corresponding
              retinal dysfunction. The topographic analysis of retinal
              thickness and retinal sensitivity will be helpful for a better

               phenotype were evaluated for prediction of the future square
               root progression rates using linear mixed-effects models.
               RESULTS: For the combined model, leave-one-out cross validation
               on patient level (Scenario 1: previously unknown patient)
               resulted in a goodness-to-fit (R value) of 0.244 and
               leave-one-out cross validation on visit level (Scenario 2:
               previous observation of the patient) in a R value of 0.391. This

               unknown patients and 39.1\% in patients with previous

               shape-descriptive factors and previous progression as prognostic
               variables for geographic atrophy progression. However, a
               substantial part of the remaining variation in geographic
               atrophy progression seems to depend on other variables, some of

               Case-control study. METHODS: Patients and age-matched controls
               were imaged with swept-source OCT-A. Using ImageJ, superficial
               and deep retinal vasculature were semi-automatically analyzed
               for vessel (VD) and skeleton density (SD), vessel diameter index
               (VDI), and fractal dimension (FD). Choriocapillaris layer was
               automatically graded for mean signal intensity, signal intensity
               standard deviation, kurtosis of signal intensity distribution,
               and flow signal voids. RESULTS: Twenty-nine intermediate uveitis
               eyes and 30 control eyes were included. Both superficial and
               deep retinal layers showed significant reduction in all OCT-A
               parameters (eg, superficial retinal layer: 0.31 vs 0.40 VD,
               5.6e-8 vs 6.4e-8 SD, 5.4e6 vs 6.1e6 VDI, and 1.78 vs 1.79 FD,

               greater heterogeneity of perfusion with a shift toward a higher
               proportion of large confluent flow signal voids was present.
               Also in the absence of macular edema OCT-A parameters were
               reduced when compared with healthy controls (all parameters

               and complexity in superficial as well as deep retinal layers and
               altered choriocapillaris perfusion are present. Moreover, these

               (+1.0, +0.5, and -2.4 dB), the mean deviation values differed
               significantly in dependence of the predominant drusen type
               (one-way ANOVA; p < 0.05). RPEDC thickness was associated with
               reduction of mesopic sensitivity (-0.34 dB/10 µm RPEDC
               thickening; p < 0.001), dark-adapted cyan sensitivity (-0.11

               sensitivity (-0.26 dB/10 µm RPEDC thickening; p < 0.001).
               CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to mesopic FCP, dark-adapted two-color
               FCP allowed for meaningful differential testing of rod and cone
               function in patients with drusen indicating predominant cone
               dysfunction in eyes with cuticular drusen and predominant rod
               dysfunction in eyes with reticular drusen. RPEDC thickness was

               area fraction: 33.15\% $\pm$ 6.86\% vs. 31.68\% $\pm$ 8.39\%; P
               = 0.517), while outside RPE atrophy rarefaction was less
               pronounced in STGD1 (AFS area fraction: 17.41\% $\pm$ 5.67\% vs.
               21.59\% $\pm$ 6.90\%; P < 0.001), to the level of
               nonsignificance compared to controls (13.27\% $\pm$ 2.99\%, P =
               0.368). Given this discrepancy, the ratio of the AFS area
               fraction within/outside of RPE atrophy could be used to
               differentiate between STGD1 and AMD with 65.0\% sensitivity and
               92.3\% specificity. Conclusions: Using OCT-A, comparison of
               choroidal flow signal within and outside the area of RPE atrophy
               revealed distinct differences between STGD1 and AMD, potentially
               implicating a differential role of the choroid in the
               pathogenesis of RPE atrophy in these two diseases.",

               atrophy lesion size in ABCA4-related retinopathy using green
               (GAF) and blue fundus autofluorescence (BAF) imaging. METHODS:
               In this cross-sectional case series, 97 eyes of 49 patients with
               RPE atrophy secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy underwent
               GAF- (518 nm excitation light) and BAF- (488 nm excitation
               light) imaging using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy
               (Spectralis HRA, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany).
               Lesions with definitely decreased autofluorescence (DDAF) and
               questionably decreased autofluorescence (QDAF) in GAF and BAF
               imaging were analyzed separately by five independent readers
               using semiautomated software (RegionFinder, Heidelberg
               Engineering). Intermodality and interreader agreements were
               assessed for the square-root lesion size, lesion perimeter, and
               circularity. RESULTS: GAF- and BAF-based measurements of DDAF
               and QDAF showed high intermodality and interreader agreement
               concerning square-root lesion size, as well as shape descriptive
               parameters (perimeter and circularity). Interreader agreement of
               square-root lesion size was slightly, hence not significantly
               higher for GAF-based grading ([95\% coefficients of
               repeatability, intraclass correlation coefficient] DDAF: 0.215
               mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.712 mm, 0.981) compared to BAF-based grading
               (DDAF: 0.232 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.764 mm, 0.978). However,
               DDAF-measurements revealed distinctly more reproducible results
               than QDAF-measurements. Foveal sparing did not interfere with
               intermodality agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Both GAF- and BAF-based
               quantification of RPE atrophy showed very reliable results with
               possible superiority of GAF in the context of less energetic
               excitation light. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The high interreader

               and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry. METHODS:
               Twenty-five eyes with GA of 25 patients (prospective,
               natural-history Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy study
               [DSGA; NCT02051998]) and 40 eyes of 40 normal subjects were
               included. Patient-tailored perimetry grids were generated using
               annotated fundus autofluorescence data. Customized software
               positioned test-points along iso-hulls surrounding the GA
               boundary at distances of 0.43°, 0.86°, 1.29°, 2.15°, and 3.01°.
               The grids were used for duplicate mesopic and dark-adapted
               two-color (cyan and red) fundus-controlled perimetry.
               Age-adjusted reference-data were obtained through regression
               analysis of normative data followed by spatial interpolation.
               RESULTS: The mean sensitivity loss for mesopic testing decreased
               with the distance to GA (-10.3 dB [0.43°], -8.2 dB [0.86°], -7.1
               dB [1.29°], -6.8 dB [2.15°], and -6.6 dB [3.01°]; P < 0.01).
               Dark-adapted cyan sensitivity loss exceeded dark-adapted red
               sensitivity loss for all iso-hulls (-14.8 vs. -11.7 dB, -13.5

               function in the junctional zone of GA with high spatial
               resolution. A distinct decrease in mesopic sensitivity loss
               between 0.43° (125 µm) and 1.29° (375 µm) was observed that
               leveled off at more distant test-points. In proximity to the GA

              METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 23 iAMD
              patients (67.3 $\pm$ 8.2 years; range, 50-85; 78\% female) and 24
              healthy controls (61.3 $\pm$ 5.2 years; range, 50-71; 50\%

              underwent duplicate mesopic (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm) and
              dark-adapted (red stimuli, 627 nm) microperimetry, using a grid
              of 33 stimuli over 14° of the central retina. Main outcome

               METHODS: A total of 50 eyes of 50 patients with nAMD (mean age,
               76.1 years) and 70 eyes of 70 age-similar normal subjects
               underwent multimodal imaging as well as mesopic and DA two-color

               underwent duplicate testing for retest reliability assessment.
               Mixed models were used for analysis of the hierarchical data.
               RESULTS: In eyes with nAMD, the coefficient of repeatability was
               (mean $\pm$ standard deviation [SD]) 5.99 $\pm$ 1.55 dB for

               Patients with foveal-sparing GA secondary to age-related macular
               degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Monocular best-corrected visual
               acuity and reading acuity together with reading speed were
               assessed using Radner charts. Fundus autofluorescence,
               near-infrared reflectance, and spectral-domain OCT images were
               acquired using a Spectralis device. The minimal required reading
               rectangle (M3R), 19 letters $\times$ 2.4 lines in the smallest
               readable print size of an individual eye, was computed. The
               status of the M3R was determined as either free of atrophy or
               involved in the atrophic process, and the impact on reading was

               and reading speed (words per minute [wpm]). RESULTS: A total of

               64.17-89.22 years]) were included. Median best-corrected visual
               acuity was 0.20 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution
               (logMAR; Snellen equivalent, 20/32). Reading score was 0.52

               141.19 wpm (IQR, 105.52-164.62 wpm). In 27 eyes, the M3R was
               involved in the atrophic process. This was associated with a
               significant worsening in Radner score (1.21 logRAD [IQR,

               162.34 wpm [IQR, 137.51-176.66 wpm]; P = 0.002). Eyes in which
               the M3R was nonatrophic additionally showed an increase in
               reading speed with decreasing print size (peak increase, +73.08
               wpm [IQR, 27.43-86.64 wpm] compared with the largest test
               sentence). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that a defined area
               on the retina that can be assessed by retinal imaging is
               required for unhindered reading in patients with foveal-sparing
               GA. The findings highlight that smaller test sentences can be
               read faster by patients with this AMD subphenotype. Our results
               allow prediction of reading impairment based on imaging
               parameters in clinical routine and may support establishing
               anatomic surrogate end points in clinical trials. Furthermore,

               similarly and had impaired cyan and red sensitivity with a
               relatively higher cyan impairment. Conclusions: Rods might be
               compromised to a greater extent than cones. Linking to previous
               studies, our results might also hint toward (postreceptoral)
               dysfunction of the cone system in very early disease stages.
               Macular pigment loss and global perimetry indices seemed to
               reflect functional impairment and might be useful as adjunct
               measures for disease progression.",

  abstract  = "IMPORTANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common
               threat to vision loss in individuals older than 50 years. While
               neovascular complications in AMD are treatable, there is
               currently no therapy for geographic atrophy secondary to AMD.
               Geographic atrophy lesion progression over time shows
               considerable interindividual variability, but little is known
               about prognostic factors. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the
               contribution of common genetic variants to geographic atrophy
               lesion growth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pooled
               analysis combined 4 independent studies: the Fundus
               Autofluorescence Imaging in Age-Related Macular Degeneration
               (FAM) study, the Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy (DSGA)
               study, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), and the
               Geographic Atrophy Treatment Evaluation (GATE) study. Each
               provided data for geographic atrophy lesion growth in specific
               designs. Patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD were
               recruited to these studies. Genotypes were retrieved through the
               database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (for AREDS) or generated at
               the Cologne Center for Genomics (for FAM, DSGA, and GATE). MAIN
               OUTCOMES: The correlation between square root-transformed
               geographic atrophy growth rate and 7 596 219 genetic variants
               passing quality control was estimated using linear regression.
               The calculations were adjusted for known factors influencing
               geographic atrophy growth, such as the presence of bilateral
               geographic atrophy as well as the number of lesion spots and
               follow-up times. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Slopes per allele,
               95\% CIs, and P values of genetic variants correlated with
               geographic atrophy lesion growth. RESULTS: A total of 935
               patients (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [7.8] years; 547 female
               participants [59.0\%]) were included. Two gene loci with
               conservative genome-wide significance were identified. Each
               minor allele of the genome-wide associated variants increased
               the geographic atrophy growth rate by a mean of about 15\% or
               0.05 mm per year. Gene prioritization within each locus suggests
               the protein arginine methyltransferase 6 gene (PRMT6; chromosome
               1; slope, 0.046 [95\% CI, 0.026-0.066]; P = 4.09 $\times$ 10-8)
               and the lanosterol synthase gene (LSS; chromosome 21; slope,
               0.105 [95\% CI, 0.068-0.143]; P = 4.07 $\times$ 10-7) as the
               most likely progression-associated genes. CONCLUSIONS AND
               RELEVANCE: These data provide further insight into the genetic
               architecture of geographic atrophy lesion growth. Geographic
               atrophy is a clinical outcome with a high medical need for
               effective therapy. The genes PRMT6 and LSS are promising
               candidates for future studies aimed at understanding functional
               aspects of geographic atrophy progression and also for designing
               novel and targeted treatment options.",

               Methods: Mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red light
               sensitivity (Goldmann III) were investigated using
               fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry). Test points were
               placed within GA along an ``iso-hull'' with a distance of
               -0.645° to the atrophy boundary. The false-positive response
               rate was determined with suprathreshold stimuli to the optic
               disc (Heijl-Krakau method) and used to compute the expected
               sensitivity measurements for the assumption of absolute
               scotomata. The outermost visible retinal layer on
               spectral-domain optical coherence tomography at the location of
               each test point was determined. Results: Thirty eyes of 36
               patients (75.55 $\pm$ 7.93 years; 19 female) from the
               prospective natural history study Directional Spread in
               Geographic Atrophy (NCT02051998), with a total of 1380 threshold
               determinations were analyzed. The measured sensitivities were
               significantly (P < 0.01) higher than the expected values for
               absolute scotomata (mean $\pm$ standard error of +6.92 $\pm$

               $\pm$ 0.74 dB for DA red testing). For mesopic testing and DA
               red testing, the presence of a residual outer nuclear layer had
               a significant effect on this discrepancy (P < 0.001). There was
               no effect of fixation stability or any other reliability index
               on this discrepancy. Conclusions: Measured sensitivities within
               the inner junctional zone of GA may not be purely explained by
               patient-specific false-positive response rates or other
               reliability indices. The marked influence of the outer retinal
               configuration on measured sensitivity may be indicative of

               by mesopic and scotopic microperimetry (MP-1S) in an elderly
               Amish population with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
               PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mesopic and scotopic microperimetric
               testing was performed in 148 eyes of 77 elderly Amish subjects
               (age > 50 years) from Pennsylvania using a retinal function
               analyzer. Scotopic testing was performed using a 2.0 log unit
               neutral density filter following 30 minutes of dark adaptation.
               All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examinations,
               including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fundus
               autofluorescence, infrared reflectance imaging, and flash color
               fundus photography. Certified graders at Doheny Image Reading
               Center identified subjects with evidence of AMD as defined by
               the Beckman classification and quantified drusen volume. RS in
               subjects with and without AMD was compared. Correlations between
               RS and drusen burden were analyzed. Ten eyes with incomplete
               MP-1S exams were excluded from the final analysis. RESULTS:
               Among the 138 eyes from 77 subjects included in the final
               analysis, 42 eyes from 29 subjects had evidence of early or
               intermediate AMD. The mean age of subjects with AMD was 69.65
               years $\pm$ 13.81 years versus 63.04 years $\pm$ 12.69 years in
               those without AMD (P = .06). Mesopic RS was 18.8 dB $\pm$ 2.1 dB
               in subjects with AMD and 19.6 dB $\pm$ 1.4 dB in those without
               AMD (P = .07). Scotopic RS was significantly lower (P = .04) in
               subjects with AMD (15.9 dB $\pm$ 2.9 dB) compared with those
               without AMD (17.3 dB $\pm$ 2.4 dB). There was no relationship
               between mesopic RS and either drusen area (r = -0.06; P = .32)
               or drusen volume (r = -0.08; P = .30). There was a trend for an
               association between scotopic RS and both drusen area (r = -0.39;
               P = .24) and drusen volume (r = -0.36; P = .30). CONCLUSIONS: In
               an elderly Amish population, eyes with early or intermediate AMD
               show a greater reduction in scotopic RS than mesopic RS,
               suggesting that rod function is more severely affected than cone
               function. Drusen area and volume measurements better correlated

               DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal natural history study.
               PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-one eyes of 91 patients with AMD
               (73.3$\pm$7.3 years; 62 female patients [50.4\%]) of the
               Molecular Diagnostic of Age-related Macular Degeneration
               (MODIAMD) study without exudative or nonexudative late-stage AMD
               in the study eye at baseline. METHODS: At each annual follow-up
               visit, all subjects underwent ophthalmic examination with
               assessment of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and retinal
               imaging, including spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT), over a study

               factors in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with
               regard to their prognostic value for conversion into advanced
               AMD stages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative structural AMD
               features and SD-OCT-based quantitative thickness changes of
               different retinal layers, such as the retinal pigment
               epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC), were assessed by multimodal
               imaging. Their prognostic relevance regarding disease conversion
               was determined using Cox regression (cloglog link function).
               RESULTS: In the multivariable analysis, the presence of focal
               hyperpigmentation, almost reaching statistical significance,
               showed the strongest effect regarding the development of
               nonexudative late-stage AMD (hazard ratio [HR], 5.88; 95\%
               confidence interval [CI], 0.69-50.2; P = 0.052) followed by the
               presence of refractile drusen (HR, 4.82; 95\% CI, 1.33-17.44; P
               = 0.0164). A thickening of the RPEDC was the only assessed
               retinal layer that exhibited a significant effect on the
               development of nonexudative advanced AMD (HR, 1.03; 95\% CI,
               1.0-1.07; P = 0.0393), whereas no association was observable for
               the other retinal layers. Neither qualitative nor quantitative
               markers were significant predictors for the development of
               exudative late-stage AMD (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results
               indicate that the development of both exudative and nonexudative
               AMD is associated with distinct prognostic features. However,
               compared with the assessment of qualitative AMD features, the
               quantification of retinal layers on average across the central
               retina had less prognostic impact. Further studies are needed to
               identify and validate robust biomarkers in early AMD stages.",

               treatment-na{\"\i}ve ``quiescent'' qCNV. We evaluated the
               qualitative and quantitative optical coherence tomography
               angiography (OCTA) features of these CNV subgroups. Methods: The
               presence of small-caliber vessels, peripheral arcades, and a
               ­perilesional OCTA signal attenuation as well as values for
               vessel length, density, and branching index were evaluated for
               each CNV network in a 6 $\times$ 6 mm OCTA scan pattern.
               Results: Fifty-one eyes of 51 patients with AMD (age 75.9 $\pm$
               7.5 years; 20 males [39.2\%]) were included. The qCNV subgroup
               (n = 8) showed the highest prevalence of qualitative and
               quantitative values for OCTA activity criteria, reaching
               significance with regard to small-caliber vessels (p = 0.003),
               peripheral arcades (p = 0.039), vessel length (p = 0.020), and
               branching index (p < 0.001) when compared to the aCNV (n = 32)
               and sCNV (n = 11) subgroups. Qualitative criteria were inversely
               associated with the number of previous anti-VEGF injections
               (each p < 0.03), while quantitative metrics also suggested lower
               values. Conclusions: These findings suggest that OCTA may be
               supportive in the phenotypical differentiation of CNV lesions
               secondary to AMD, while the assessed structural changes appeared
               to be more indicative of previously administered anti-VEGF

               context of 2 noninterventional, prospective studies conducted at
               the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn, Germany.
               PARTICIPANTS: A total of 98 eyes diagnosed with AMD of 59
               patients (40 female, 19 male) with a mean ($\pm$standard
               deviation) age at baseline of 76.60$\pm$6.65 years and median
               (interquartile range) review period of 1.17 years (1.01-1.55)
               were included. Eyes were subdivided into 3 categories based on
               multimodal imaging and ocular history: retinal pigment
               epithelium (RPE) atrophy with treatment-na{\"\i}ve quiescent CNV
               (n=7), RPE atrophy with a history of exudative CNV (n=10), and
               RPE atrophy without evidence of coexisting CNV (n=81). METHODS:
               Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was delineated on the basis
               of serial fundus-autofluorescence and infrared-reflectance
               images. If CNV was detected by OCT angiography (OCTA), its
               location and dimension were spatially mapped to RPE atrophy. The
               localized progression of RPE atrophy in topographic relation to
               the CNV lesion was then analyzed using mixed-effects logistic
               regression. The spatial overlap (Dice coefficient) between
               predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression was evaluated to
               estimate the model accuracy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratio
               (OR) for localized RPE atrophy progression in areas overlying
               type 1 CNV. RESULTS: The prediction model achieved a high
               overlap between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression
               with a cross-validated Dice coefficient of 0.87 (95\% confidence
               interval [CI], 0.85-0.89) reflecting a high accuracy. The odds
               for future RPE atrophy involvement were reduced by a factor of
               0.21 (95\% CI, 0.19-0.24) in the presence of
               treatment-na{\"\i}ve quiescent type 1 CNV and by a factor of
               0.46 (95\% CI, 0.41-0.51) in the presence of exudative type 1
               CNV. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is markedly
               reduced RPE atrophy progression in areas co-localizing with
               quiescent and exudative type 1 CNV. This observation is
               compatible with a potential protective effect of type 1 CNV on
               the RPE and overlying neurosensory retina. These results may
               have relevant clinical implications for the management of CNV
               and lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent atrophy
               progression.",

               using a test stimulus (2° diameter) projected at 5° eccentricity
               horizontal from the foveal center within the temporal parafovea.
               Cone plateau, rod intercept time, and rod recovery rate (S2)
               were calculated from the resulting DA curves. Findings were
               correlated with disease stages (according to Gass and Blodi),
               the area of ellipsoid zone loss in optical coherence tomography,
               and macular pigment loss (``MP-Classes 1-3''). RESULTS:
               Fifty-nine eyes of 59 patients were compared with 18 eyes of 18
               healthy controls. Dark adaptation was significantly impaired in
               patients with MacTel. Although differences were most pronounced

               recovery was also decreased, yet to a lesser extent. Dark

               METHODS: In this prospective case-control study, dark adaptation
               thresholds were measured using a Goldmann-Weekers dark
               adaptometer. Additional assessments included best-corrected

               Autofluorescence imaging with blue (BAF), green (GAF), and
               near-infrared (NIR-AF) excitation wavelengths obtained by a
               confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope was compared with AF
               imaging obtained by an innovative confocal light-emitting
               diode-based retinal imaging system (Color-AF) that allows for

               Flecks that showed predominantly red emission fluorescent

               Over the observation time of 5 to 14 months, flecks showed a

               encoding for collagen type IV. Methods: Twenty-eight eyes of
               nine patients with AS, and five autosomal-recessive carriers and
               15 eyes from 15 age-similar healthy control subjects were
               examined using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
               OCT-angiography (OCT-A). Foveal configuration and FAZ measures
               including the FAZ area, circularity, and vessel density in the
               central 1° and 3° were correlated. Results: Foveal hypoplasia
               was found in 10 eyes from seven patients with either genotype.
               In contrast, a staircase foveopathy was found in seven eyes of
               four X-linked AS patients. The average FAZ area did not differ
               significantly between AS patients and control subjects (mean
               $\pm$ SD 0.24 $\pm$ 0.24 mm2 vs. 0.21 $\pm$ 0.09 mm2; P = 0.64).
               Five eyes showed absence or severe anomalies of the FAZ with
               crossing macular capillaries that was linked to the degree of
               foveal hypoplasia on OCT images leading to a significant inverse
               correlation of FAZ area and foveal thickness (r = -0.88; P <
               0.001). In contrary, female patients with X-linked mutations
               exhibited a significantly greater FAZ area (0.48 $\pm$ 0.30 mm2
               vs. 0.21 $\pm$ 0.09 mm2; P = 0.007), in line with OCT findings
               of a staircase foveopathy. Conclusions: The foveal phenotypic
               spectrum in AS ranges from foveal hypoplasia and absence of a
               FAZ to staircase foveopathy with an enlarged FAZ. Because the
               development of the FAZ and foveal pit are closely related, these
               findings suggest an important role for collagen type IV in
               foveal development and maturation.",

               to determine the prognostic value of structural precursor
               lesions in eyes with intermediate (i) AMD on the subsequent GA
               progression. METHODS: Structural precursor lesions for atrophic
               areas (lesion size at least 0.5 mm² in fundus autofluorescence
               images) were retrospectively identified based on multimodal
               imaging and evaluated for association with the subsequent GA
               enlargement rates (square-root transformed, sqrt). A linear
               mixed-effects model was used to account for the hierarchical
               nature of the data with a Tukey post hoc test to assess the
               impact of the local precursor on the subsequent GA progression
               rate. RESULTS: A total of 39 eyes with GA of 34 patients with a
               mean age of 74.4$\pm$6.7 ($\pm$SD) years were included in this
               study. Five precursor lesions (phenotypes 1-5) preceding GA
               development were identified: large, sub-retinal pigment
               epithelial drusen (n=19), reticular pseudodrusen (RPD, n=10),
               refractile deposits (n=4), pigment epithelial detachment (n=4)
               and vitelliform lesions (n=2). Precursor lesions exhibited a
               significant association with the subsequent (sqrt) GA
               progression rates (p=0.0018) with RPD (phenotype 2) being
               associated with the fastest GA enlargement (2.29$\pm$0.52

               prognostic relevance of iAMD phenotyping for subsequent GA

               (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by
               using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. DESIGN:
               Prospective, observational case series. METHODS: A total of 41
               eyes of 41 patients (75.8 $\pm$ 8.4 years old; 22 females) from
               a tertiary referral hospital were included. Mesopic,
               dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red sensitivities were assessed by
               using fundus-controlled perimetry (``microperimetry''); and
               retinal microstructure was assessed by using spectral-domain
               optical-coherence-tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence
               (FAF), and near-infrared-reflectance (IR) imaging. Layer
               thicknesses and intensities and FAF and IR intensities were
               extracted for each test point. The cross-validated mean absolute
               error (MAE) was evaluated for random forest-based predictions of
               retinal sensitivity with and without patient-specific training
               data and percentage of increased mean-squared error (\%IncMSE)
               as measurement of feature importance. RESULTS: Retinal
               sensitivity was predicted with a MAE of 4.64 dB for mesopic,
               4.89 dB for DA cyan, and 4.40 dB for DA red testing in the
               absence of patient-specific data. Partial addition of
               patient-specific sensitivity data to the training sets decreased
               the MAE to 2.89 dB, 2.86 dB, and 2.77 dB. For all 3 types of
               testing, the outer nuclear layer thickness constituted the most
               important predictive feature (35.0, 42.22, and 53.74 \%IncMSE).
               Spatially resolved mapping of ``inferred sensitivity'' revealed
               regions with differential degrees of mesopic and DA cyan
               sensitivity loss outside of the GA lesions. CONCLUSIONS:
               ``Inferred sensitivity'' accurately reflected retinal function
               in patients with GA. Mapping of ``inferred sensitivity'' could
               facilitate monitoring of disease progression and serve as

               in Stargardt disease (STGD1). METHODS: In this retrospective,
               monocentre cohort study, 271 eyes of 136 patients (age, 37.1
               years) with STGD1 and 87 eyes of 54 healthy controls (age, 41.0
               years) underwent mesopic FCP, using a pattern of 50 stimuli
               (achromatic, 400-800 nm) centred on the fovea. The concurrent
               validity of mesopic FCP testing using the MAIA device
               (CenterVue, Italy), the retest variability and its determinants,
               and the progression of sensitivity loss over time were
               investigated using mixed-model analyses. The main outcomes were
               the average pointwise sensitivity loss in dependence of
               patients' demographic, functional and imaging characteristics,
               the intrasession 95\% coefficient of repeatability, and the
               pointwise sensitivity loss over time. RESULTS: Pointwise
               sensitivity loss was on average (estimate (95\% CI)) 13.88 dB
               (12.55 to 15.21) along the horizontal meridian and was
               significantly associated with the electrophysiological subgroup,
               presence/absence of foveal sparing, best-corrected visual acuity
               and disease duration. The 95\% coefficient of repeatability was
               12.15 dB (10.78 to 13.38) and varied in dependence of the
               underlying mean sensitivity and local sensitivity slope. The
               global progression rate for the sensitivity loss was 0.45
               dB/year (0.13 to 0.78) and was higher for the central and inner
               ETDRS subfields compared with more peripheral regions.
               CONCLUSIONS: Mesopic light sensitivity measured by FCP is
               reliable and susceptible for functional changes. It constitutes

               reviewed over a period of $\geq$8 months. Examinations at
               monthly intervals included visual acuity testing, dilated
               funduscopy, spectral domain-OCT and OCT-A. Eyes were treated
               with intravitreal VEGF (vascular endothelial growth
               factor)-inhibitors following a pro-re-nata (PRN) regime, and
               treatment decisions were based on morphological signs of
               activity as determined by B-scan OCT and funduscopy. Signs of
               neovascular activity were defined as an increase in retinal
               thickness, presence/increase of intraretinal/subretinal fluid

               of both treatment effects (regression) and progression (growth)
               of NVs, but not neovascular activity. The growth of neovascular
               vessels was detectable in OCT-A before signs of activity

               mesopic and by -2.34 dB (95\% CI, -2.85 to -1.84) for scotopic
               testing compared with controls with a pointwise sensitivity

               respectively (P < 0.001). Retinal thickness analysis in patients
               revealed a significantly thinner outer nuclear layer (ONL) by
               -0.49 standard deviation (SD; 95\% CI, -0.70 to -0.28 SD) and a
               significant thicker retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex
               (RPEDC) by +3.22 SD (95\% CI, 2.27-4.17 SD) at baseline,
               respectively (P < 0.001). During follow-up, retinal thickness
               thickened further by +0.51 SD/year (RPEDC) and thinned by -0.03
               SD/year (ONL; P = 0.045) and -0.34 SD/year (inner and outer
               photoreceptor segments) in patients, respectively (P < 0.001).
               Structure-function analysis showed a significant association of
               the ONL and the RPEDC thickness change with both types of FCP
               sensitivity testing (P < 0.001). Besides, follow-up time had a
               significant (independent) effect on mesopic and scotopic retinal
               sensitivity (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The longitudinal
               structure-function correlation demonstrated a progressive
               quantifiable degeneration of the outer retina in iAMD associated
               with photoreceptor dysfunction. Because longitudinal sensitivity
               changes could not be explained by structural changes alone, an
               unmet need remains for additional refined parameters on retinal
               structure to predict retinal function.",

               autofluorescence (qAF) imaging measurements between eyes with
               and without large drusen, and whether qAF measurements change
               over time in the eyes with large drusen. METHODS: Eighty-five
               eyes from participants with bilateral large drusen and 51 eyes
               from healthy participants underwent qAF imaging at least once,
               and the age-related macular degeneration participants were
               reviewed 6-monthly. Normalized grey values at 9° to 11°
               eccentricity from the fovea were averaged to provide a summary
               measure of qAF values (termed qAF8). RESULTS: In a multivariable
               model, qAF8 measurements were not significantly different
               between age-related macular degeneration eyes with large drusen
               and healthy eyes (P = 0.130), and qAF8 measurements showed a
               decline over time in the age-related macular degeneration eyes
               (P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: These findings add to the body of
               evidence that qAF levels are not increased in eyes with large
               drusen compared with healthy eyes, and qAF levels show a
               significant decline over time in the age-related macular
               degeneration eyes. These findings highlight how the relationship
               between qAF levels and retinal pigment epithelium health does
               not seem to be straightforward. Further investigation is
               required to better understand this relationship, especially if

               reticular pseudodrusen (RPD). Methods: At baseline 30 eyes of 25
               iAMD patients underwent optical coherence tomography imaging,
               mesopic and scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) with

               Results: At baseline, the thickness of the partial outer retinal
               layer (pORL, 70.21 vs. 77.47 µm) and both mesopic (16.60 vs.
               18.72 dB) and scotopic (12.14 vs. 18.67 dB) retinal sensitivity
               were decreased in areas with RPD compared with unremarkable

               -0.66 normative standard deviation (SD; i.e., z-score, P <

               future GA progression, and to characterize its spatio-temporal

               cohort study (Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy
               [NCT02051998]) and analysis of data from a normative data study
               at a tertiary referral center. One hundred fifty-eight eyes of
               89 patients with a mean (SD) age of 77.7 (7.1) years, median
               area of GA of 8.87 mm2 (IQR, 4.09-15.60), and median follow-up
               of 1.1 years (IQR, 0.52-1.7 years), as well as 93 normal eyes

               optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volume scans (121 B-scans
               across 30° $\times$ 25°) were segmented with a deep-learning

               photoreceptor inner segment (IS), and outer segment (OS)
               thickness were quantified along evenly spaced contour lines
               surrounding GA lesions. Linear mixed models were applied to
               assess the association between photoreceptor-related imaging
               features and GA progression rates and characterize the pattern

               Measures: Association of ONL thinning with follow-up time (after
               adjusting for age, retinal topography [z score], and distance to
               the GA boundary). Results: The study included 158 eyes of 89
               patients (51 women and 38 men) with a mean (SD) age of 77.7
               (7.1) years. The fully automated B-scan segmentation was
               accurate (dice coefficient, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.85; compared
               with manual markings) and revealed a marked interpatient
               variability in photoreceptor degeneration. The ellipsoid zone
               (EZ) loss-to-GA boundary distance and OS thickness were
               prognostic for future progression rates. Outer nuclear layer and
               IS thinning over time was significant even when adjusting for
               age and proximity to the GA boundary (estimates of -0.16
               $\mu$m/y; 95\% CI, -0.30 to -0.02; and -0.17 $\mu$m/y; 95\% CI,
               -0.26 to -0.09). Conclusions and Relevance: Distinct and
               progressive alterations of photoreceptor laminae (exceeding GA
               spatially) were detectable and quantifiable. The degree of
               photoreceptor degeneration outside of regions of retinal pigment
               epithelium atrophy varied markedly between eyes and was
               associated with future GA progression. Macula-wide photoreceptor
               laminae thinning represents a potential candidate end point to

               small-vessel damage as described histologically. Noninvasive
               optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) makes it
               possible to image retinal and choroidal capillaries on a
               microscopic level in vivo. We quantified eye vessel perfusion
               changes in hypertensive crisis using OCTA. Methods: Patients
               with hypertensive crisis (systolic blood pressure $\geq$180 mm
               Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure $\geq$110 mm Hg) and
               age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. OCTA en
               face 3 $\times$ 3-mm images of the superficial and deep retinal
               layers and the choriocapillaris were acquired. Outcome
               parameters included vessel density (VD) and vessel skeleton
               density (VSD) of the superficial and deep retinal layers, as
               well as flow voids of the choriocapillaris. Results:
               Twenty-eight eyes of 17 patients and 31 age-matched control eyes
               of 18 healthy subjects were included. VD and VSD of the deep
               retinal layer were significantly reduced in hypertensive crisis
               (P $\leq$ 0.004). Choriocapillaris signal intensity was more
               heterogeneous in patients, and flow voids exhibited confluence
               with a larger average area and a lower absolute count (P $\leq$
               0.045). These changes were independent of time since onset of
               hypertensive crisis and of the presence and extent of
               retinopathy. Deep retinal changes were associated with renal
               end-organ failure (P = 0.045). Conclusions: Hypertensive crisis
               is associated with a significant reduction in retinal and
               choroidal capillary perfusion based on OCTA findings. These
               alterations are independent of retinopathy and related to
               end-organ damage. Translational Relevance: OCTA might help
               distinguish hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency
               earlier than currently possible.",

               everyday clinical practice in ophthalmology since the
               introduction of the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK) formula. Recent
               developments in the field of statistical learning (artificial
               intelligence, AI) now enable an empirical approach to a wide
               range of ophthalmological questions with an unprecedented
               precision. OBJECTIVE: Which criteria must be considered for the
               evaluation of AI-related studies in ophthalmology? MATERIAL AND
               METHODS: Exemplary prediction of visual acuity (continuous
               outcome) and classification of healthy and diseased eyes
               (discrete outcome) using retrospectively compiled optical
               coherence tomography data (50 eyes of 50 patients, 50 healthy
               eyes of 50 subjects). The data were analyzed with nested
               cross-validation (for learning algorithm selection and
               hyperparameter optimization). RESULTS: Based on nested
               cross-validation for training, visual acuity could be predicted
               in the separate test data-set with a mean absolute error (MAE,
               95\% confidence interval, CI of 0.142 LogMAR [0.077; 0.207]).
               Healthy versus diseased eyes could be classified in the test
               data-set with an agreement of 0.92 (Cohen's kappa). The
               exemplary incorrect learning algorithm and variable selection
               resulted in an MAE for visual acuity prediction of 0.229 LogMAR
               [0.150; 0.309] for the test data-set. The drastic overfitting
               became obvious on comparison of the MAE with the null model MAE
               (0.235 LogMAR [0.148; 0.322]). CONCLUSION: Selection of an
               unsuitable measure of the goodness-of-fit, inadequate
               validation, or withholding of a null or reference model can
               obscure the actual goodness-of-fit of AI models. The illustrated
               pitfalls can help clinicians to identify such shortcomings.",

               well as research. The accurate spatial characterization of

               This is especially important for monitoring of retinal diseases

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Two-colour computerised perimetry is a technique
               developed for assessing cone- and rod-function at fixed
               background luminances in retinal disease. However, the state of
               adaptation during testing is unknown but crucial in the
               interpretation of results. We therefore aimed to determine the
               adaptational state of rod- and cone-mechanisms in two-colour
               perimetry. METHODS: Sensitivity to 480 nm (blue) and 640 nm
               (red) Goldmann size V targets was determined for 10 normal
               subjects aged 16 to 46 years at 17 locations in the central 60
               degrees of the visual field under scotopic conditions and then
               from -1.5 log cd m-2 to 2 log cd m-2 (white background) in 0.5
               log unit steps. Data were fitted with threshold versus intensity
               (tvi) functions of the form logT = logT0 + log ((A + A0 )/A0 )n
               . RESULTS: No clear rod-cone break was observed for 640 nm
               stimuli. For 480 nm stimuli, transition from rod-detection to
               cone-detection occurred at mesopic illumination levels, where
               rod adaptation approached Weber behaviour. Cone detection
               mechanisms did not display Weber-like adaptation until the
               background luminance approached 1 log cd.m-2 . Diseases
               resulting in a ``filter effect'' - including disorders of the
               photoreceptors - are therefore predicted to affect sensitivity
               when rod function is probed with short-wavelength targets under
               scotopic conditions, but less so under mesopic conditions.
               Filter effects are similarly anticipated to affect cone function
               measured using long-wavelength targets under mesopic conditions
               (e.g., during microperimetry), but less so under photopic
               conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Asymmetries in adaptation in automated
               two-colour perimetry are predicted to artefactually favour the
               detection of losses in rod sensitivity under scotopic conditions
               and cones under mesopic conditions.",

               correlates associated with a diseased Bruch membrane in patients
               with PXE. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective,
               single-center, cross-sectional case-control study was conducted
               at a tertiary referral center from January 31, 2018, to February
               20, 2020. Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients with PXE and 40 eyes of
               40 healthy individuals were included. Data analysis was
               completed March 15, 2020. Exposures: Mesopic and dark-adapted
               2-color fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry) and
               multimodal retinal imaging including spectral-domain optical
               coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and OCT angiography were
               performed. Perimetry thresholds were analyzed using mixed
               models, and structure-function correlation with SD-OCT data was
               performed using machine learning. Main Outcomes and Measures:
               Observed dark-adapted cyan sensitivity loss as measure of rod
               photoreceptor dysfunction, as well as mean absolute error
               between predicted and observed retinal sensitivity to assess the
               accuracy of structure-function correlation. Results: Of the 22
               patients with PXE included in this study, 15 were women (68\%);
               median age was 56.5 years (interquartile range, 50.4-61.2).
               These patients exhibited mesopic (estimate, 5.13 dB; 95\% CI,
               2.89-7.38 dB), dark-adapted cyan (estimate, 9.08 dB; 95\% CI,
               6.34-11.82 dB), and dark-adapted red (estimate, 7.05 dB; 95\%
               CI, 4.83-9.27 dB) sensitivity losses. This sensitivity loss was
               also evident in 9 eyes with nonneovascular PXE (mesopic:
               estimate, 3.21 dB; 95\% CI, 1.28-5.14 dB; dark-adapted cyan:
               5.93 dB; 95\% CI, 3.59-8.27 dB; and dark-adapted red testing:
               4.84 dB; 95\% CI, 2.88-6.80 dB), showing a distinct centrifugal
               pattern of sensitivity loss with preserved function toward the
               periphery. Retinal function could be predicted from
               microstructure with high accuracy (mean absolute errors, of 4.91
               dB for mesopic, 5.44 dB for dark-adapted cyan, and 4.99 dB for
               dark-adapted red). The machine learning-based analysis
               highlighted an association of a thinned inner retina and
               putative separation of the pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor
               complex with sensitivity loss. Conclusions and Relevance: In
               this study, among 22 patients with PXE, those with and without
               choroidal neovascularization exhibited reductions of retinal
               sensitivity being most pronounced in dark-adapted cyan testing.
               This finding suggests that pathologic characteristics of this
               Bruch membrane disease may be dominated by rod photoreceptor
               degeneration and/or dysfunction. A putative
               pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor separation may further impair
               rod function, while inner retinal abnormalities appear to be
               correlated with overall dysfunction.",

              manual and an automated approach in eyes with age-related macular
              degeneration (AMD) and healthy controls. The rEZR obtained from

              participants with a mean ($\pm$ standard deviation) age of 65.2
              $\pm$ 7.8 years were included. Both the manual and automated
              method showed that control eyes exhibit a greater rEZR than AMD
              eyes (P < 0.001). Overall, the limits of agreement between the
              manual and automated method were -7.5 to 7.3 arbitrary units (AU)
              and 95\% of the data points had a difference in the rEZR between
              the methods of $\pm$8.2\%. An expected perfect reproducibility
              was observed for the automated method, whereas the manual method

               correlation of clinical data with data obtained from postmortem
               tissue donation is of great benefit. In this respect, the
               establishment of an eye donation registry represents a
               prerequisite for the acquisition of such data. METHODS: A total
               of 300 patients were interviewed at a tertiary referral center
               in Germany by means of a standardized questionnaire. Binary
               questions were evaluated by percentage; Likert-scaled questions
               (1 = does apply; 5 = does not apply) were analyzed by the median
               and 25th (Q25) and 75th (Q75) percentiles. RESULTS: The majority
               of patients (77.0\%) would agree to donate their eyes for
               research purposes. When asked about reasons against an eye
               donation, 60.9\% of all patients only stated reasons in the
               category ``addressable'' (e.g., not enough awareness of the
               topic). The vast majority of patients considered it appropriate
               for an ophthalmologist to approach them on the issue of
               postmortem eye donation (median 1, Q25 1, Q75 1). CONCLUSION:
               Overall, patients had a positive attitude towards postmortem eye
               donation for research purposes. Importantly, reasons given
               against postmortem eye donation were often related to
               misconceptions and were potentially addressable. These results
               underline the fundamental willingness of ophthalmological
               patients in Germany to donate their eyes postmortem for research
               purposes.",

               on optical coherence tomography and report its prevalence in
               macular telangiectasia Type 2. METHODS: In a primary
               cross-sectional analysis, multimodal imaging data were
               retrospectively analyzed. The definition of hyperreflectivity
               and neovascularization on optical coherence tomography followed
               optical coherence tomography angiography-based criteria. Eyes
               were graded for the presence of hyperreflectivity and
               neovascularization and further categorized into three classes
               based on position and extent of hyperreflectivity. In a
               secondary analysis, eyes were reviewed for $\geq$24 months using
               optical coherence tomography imaging. RESULTS: Three hundred and
               twenty-two eyes from 161 patients were analyzed in the
               cross-sectional analysis. Hyperreflectivity was found in 177
               (55\%) and neovascular membranes in 49 (15\%) eyes.
               Hyperreflectivity correlated significantly with parameters
               indicative of disease progression. In the longitudinal analysis,
               206 eyes from 103 patients were reviewed over a mean of 35.6
               months. 17/86 eyes (20\%) showed a de novo development of
               hyperreflectivity. 8/29 eyes (28\%) with preexistent
               intraretinal hyperreflectivity developed outer retinal
               hyperreflectivity. A high proportion of eyes with outer retinal
               hyperreflectivity (17/52 [33\%]) developed neovascular
               membranes. CONCLUSION: Hyperreflectivity represents a common
               finding in macular telangiectasia Type 2 but lacks a uniform
               definition. We propose a hyperreflectivity grading scale that
               may help to estimate disease progression and identify eyes at
               risk for developing neovascular membranes.",

               their related features in age-related macular degeneration
               (AMD). DESIGN: Interreader agreement study. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve
               readers from 6 reading centers. METHODS: After formal training,
               readers qualitatively assessed 60 OCT B-scans from 60 eyes with
               AMD for 9 individual features associated with early atrophy and
               performed 7 different annotations to quantify the spatial extent
               of OCT features within regions of interest. The qualitative and
               quantitative features were used to derive the presence of iRORA
               and cRORA and also in an exploratory analysis to examine if
               agreement could be improved using different combinations of
               features to define OCT atrophy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
               Interreader agreement based on Gwet's first-order agreement
               coefficient (AC1) for qualitatively graded OCT features and
               classification of iRORA and cRORA, and smallest real difference
               (SRD) for quantitatively graded OCT features. RESULTS:
               Substantial or better interreader agreement was observed for all
               qualitatively graded OCT features associated with atrophy (AC1 =
               0.63-0.87), except for RPE attenuation (AC1 = 0.46) and
               disruption (AC1 = 0.26). The lowest SRD for the quantitatively
               graded horizontal features was observed for the zone of
               choroidal hypertransmission ($\pm$ 190.8 $\mu$m). Moderate
               agreement was found for a 3-category classification of no
               atrophy, iRORA, and cRORA (AC1 = 0.53). Exploratory analyses
               suggested a significantly higher level of agreement for a
               3-category classification using (1) no atrophy; (2) presence of
               inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer subsidence, or a
               hyporeflective wedge-shaped band, as a less severe atrophic
               grade; and (3) the latter plus an additional requirement of
               choroidal hypertransmission of 250 $\mu$m or more for a more
               severe atrophic grade (AC1 = 0.68; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS:
               Assessment of iRORA and cRORA, and most of their associated
               features, can be performed relatively consistently and robustly.
               A refined combination of features to define early atrophy could

               intelligence (AI) to infer results of psychophysical
               examinations based on findings derived from multimodal imaging.
               We conducted a review of the current literature referenced in

               'artificial intelligence' and 'machine learning' in combination
               with 'perimetry', 'best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)',
               'retinal function' and 'age-related macular degeneration'. So
               far AI-based structure-function correlations have been applied
               to infer conventional visual field, fundus-controlled perimetry,
               and electroretinography data, as well as BCVA, and
               patient-reported outcome measures (PROM). In neovascular AMD,
               inference of BCVA (hereafter termed inferred BCVA) can estimate
               BCVA results with a root mean squared error of ~7-11 letters,
               which is comparable to the accuracy of actual visual acuity
               assessment. Further, AI-based structure-function correlation can
               successfully infer fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) results
               both for mesopic as well as dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red
               testing (hereafter termed inferred sensitivity). Accuracy of
               inferred sensitivity can be augmented by adding short FCP
               examinations and reach mean absolute errors (MAE) of ~3-5 dB for
               mesopic, DA cyan and DA red testing. Inferred BCVA, and inferred
               retinal sensitivity, based on multimodal imaging, may be
               considered as a quasi-functional surrogate endpoint for future
               interventional clinical trials in the future.",

               Telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) using multimodal retinal imaging.
               METHODS: In this retrospective study, eyes with a minimum
               observation period of 6 months prior to the de novo diagnosis of
               an exudative neovascularisation secondary to MacTel were

               neovascularisation were evaluated using colour fundus
               photography, infrared imaging, fluorescein angiography, macular
               pigment measurement and optical coherence tomography (OCT).
               OCT-angiography (OCT-A) images were additionally available in a
               subset of patients. RESULTS: Twenty eyes from 20 patients were
               examined over a median period of 17 months (range: 6-100
               months). Eyes were characterised by an accelerated progression
               of ellipsoid zone loss (median of 0.013 mm2/month), increased
               thickness of the temporal parafovea and hyper-reflective lesions
               on OCT. The latter underwent morphological changes preceding the
               development of exudative neovascularisation, including an
               increase in size and density, and expansion to outer retinal
               layers and the retinal pigment epithelium. All eyes showed a
               foveal depletion of macular pigment. On OCT-A, a focal increase
               in blood flow was observed at the level of the outer

               preceding the formation of exudative neovascularisation in
               MacTel. Eyes exhibiting these characteristics should be

               Machine-learning models were probed to predict the anti-VEGF

               forecasting was performed using natural gradient boosting

               Results: In a total of 138 visits of 99 eyes with neovascular

               frequency in real-world settings. Translational Relevance:
               Prediction of a probability distribution allows the physician to

               characteristics including the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)
               thickness in patients with RPGR-associated retinitis pigmentosa
               (RP). METHODS: This cross-sectional case-control study included
               17 consecutive patients (median age, 21 years) with
               RPGR-associated RP who underwent retinal imaging including
               optical coherence tomography (OCT), short-wavelength fundus
               autofluorescence (AF) imaging, and RNFL scans centered on the
               optic disc. RNFL thickness was manually segmented and compared
               to clinical and imaging parameters including the transfoveal
               ellipsoid zone (EZ) width, the horizontal diameter of the
               macular hyperautofluorescent ring. RNFL thickness was compared
               to 17 age- and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: In patients with
               RPGR-associated RP, the EZ width (R2 = 0.65), the central
               hyperautofluorescent ring on AF images (R2 = 0.72), and visual
               acuity (R2 = 0.68) were negatively correlated with age. In
               comparison to controls, a significantly (p < 0.0001) increased
               global RNFL thickness was identified in RPGR-associated RP,
               which was, however, less pronounced in progressed disease as
               indicated by the EZ width or the diameter of the central
               hyperautofluorescent ring. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes
               retinal characteristics in patients with RPGR-associated RP
               including a pronounced peripapillary RNFL thickness compared to
               healthy controls. These results contribute to the knowledge
               about imaging biomarkers in RP, which might be of interest for

               systematically compare visual function tests for interventional
               trials. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS:
               Patients with SFD (n = 16) and controls (n = 20) underwent
               visual function testing (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] and
               low luminance visual acuity [LLVA], contrast sensitivity,
               mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) fundus-controlled perimetry [FCP],
               rod-mediated dark adaptation [RMDA]), and multimodal imaging.
               Vision-related quality of life was evaluated. FCP and RMDA
               thresholds were analyzed using mixed models and
               structure-function correlation using machine learning (ML).
               Longitudinal data of 1 patient with high-dose vitamin A
               supplementation were available. RESULTS: Although photopic BCVA
               was normative in SFD, LLVA was impaired (0.30 LogMAR [0.20;
               0.45] vs 0.20 LogMAR [0.03; 0.28], P < .05). Scotopic visual
               function exhibited a delayed rod-intercept time (21 minutes
               [12.15; 21] vs 4.05 minutes [3.22; 5.36], P < .001), and marked
               DA cyan mean sensitivity loss (-11.80 dB [-3.47; -19.85]),
               paralleled by a reduced vision-related quality of life. ML-based
               structure-function correlation allowed prediction of mesopic, DA
               cyan, and red sensitivity with high accuracy (cross-validated
               mean absolute error: 4.36, 7.77, and 5.31 dB, respectively),
               whereas RMDA could be slowed even in the absence of fundus
               alterations on multimodal imaging. After high-dose vitamin A
               supplementation, RMDA and DA thresholds improved markedly.
               CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SFD exhibit severely impaired
               scotopic visual function even in the absence of funduscopic
               alterations on multimodal imaging. In contrast to BCVA, scotopic
               visual function tests are suitable to quantify dysfunction in
               the early stages. Improvement of scotopic dysfunction after
               (off-label) high-dose vitamin A intake, as observed in one
               patient in our study, is compatible with the hypothesized local

               in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by
               building a suitable statistical regression model for GA size
               measurements obtained from fundus autofluorescence imaging.
               METHODS: Based on theoretical considerations, we develop a
               linear mixed-effects model for GA size progression that
               incorporates covariable-dependent enlargement rates as well as
               correlations between longitudinally collected GA size
               measurements. To capture nonlinear progression in a flexible
               way, we systematically assess Box-Cox transformations with
               different transformation parameters $\lambda$. Model evaluation
               is performed on data collected for two longitudinal, prospective
               multi-center cohort studies on GA size progression. RESULTS: A
               transformation parameter of $\lambda$=0.45 yielded the best
               model fit regarding the Akaike information criterion (AIC). When
               hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were included as risk
               factors in the model, they showed an association with
               progression of GA size. The mean estimated age-of-onset in this
               model was 67.21$\pm$6.49 years. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a
               comprehensive framework for modeling the course of uni- or
               bilateral GA size progression in longitudinal observational
               studies. Specifically, the model allows for age-of-onset
               estimation, identification of risk factors and prediction of
               future GA size. A square-root transformation of atrophy size is
               recommended before model fitting.",

               require suitable end points. The characterization and validation
               of reading performance as a functional outcome parameter is
               warranted. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate reading
               performance in geographic atrophy and to assess its association
               with established visual function assessments and structural
               biomarkers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The
               noninterventional, prospective natural history Directional
               Spread in Geographic Atrophy study included patients with
               geographic atrophy secondary to AMD who were recruited at the
               University Hospital in Bonn, Germany. Participants were enrolled
               from June 2013 to June 2016. Analysis began December 2019 and
               ended January 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reading acuity
               and reading speed were assessed using Radner charts.
               Longitudinal fundus autofluorescence and infrared reflectance
               images were semiautomatically annotated for geographic atrophy,
               followed by extraction of shape-descriptive variables. Linear
               mixed-effects models were applied to investigate the association
               of those variables with reading performance. RESULTS: A total of
               150 eyes of 85 participants were included in this study (median
               [IQR] age, 77.9 [72.4-82.1] years; 51 women [60\%]; 34 men
               [40\%]). Reading performance was impaired with a median (IQR)
               monocular reading acuity of 0.9 (0.4-1.3) logarithm of the
               reading acuity determination and a reading speed of 52.8 (0-123)
               words per minute. In the multivariable cross-sectional analysis,
               best-corrected visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the
               central Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
               subfield, classification of noncenter vs center-involving
               geographic atrophy, and area of geographic atrophy in the
               inner-right ETDRS subfield showed strongest associations with
               reading acuity (cross-validated R2for reading acuity = 0.69).
               Regarding reading speed, the most relevant variables were
               best-corrected visual acuity, low-luminance visual acuity, area
               of geographic atrophy in the central ETDRS subfield, in the
               inner-right ETDRS subfield, and in the inner-upper ETDRS
               subfield (R2 for reading speed = 0.67). In the longitudinal
               analysis, a similar prediction accuracy for reading performance
               was determined (R2 for reading acuity = 0.73; R2 for reading
               speed = 0.70). Prediction accuracy did not improve when
               follow-up time was added as an independent variable. Binocular
               reading performance did not differ from reading performance in
               the better-seeing eye. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The
               association of reading acuity and speed with visual functional
               and structural biomarkers supports the validity of reading
               performance as a meaningful end point in clinical trials. These
               findings suggest that measures in clinical and low-vision care
               for patients with geographic atrophy should focus primarily on
               the better-seeing eye.",

              coherence tomography imaging data from patients with PXE were
              compared with controls. A custom deep-learning-based segmentation

              GCL thickness in the outer ETDRS subfields as dependent variables

              Fourty-eight eyes of 30 patients with PXE were compared with 100

               FD (p = 0.061). The CC FD density was associated with an altered
               microstructure of the overlying photoreceptors (outer segments,
               inner segments, and outer nuclear layer thinning of -0.19
               $\mu$m, -0.08 $\mu$m and -0.30 $\mu$m per \%FD, respectively,
               all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early SFD exhibit
               pronounced abnormalities of CC flow signal on OCTA, which are
               not limited to areas of sub-RPE deposits seen on OCT imaging.
               Thus, analysis of the CC flow may enable clinical trials at
               earlier disease stages in SFD.",
